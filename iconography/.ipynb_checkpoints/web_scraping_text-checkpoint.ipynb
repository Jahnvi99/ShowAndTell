      "The <font color=\"ff0000\">Rape</font> of the Sabines marked the climax of Giambologna's career as an official Medici sculptor. This great marble was unveiled in the Loggia dei Lanzi in January 1583 in place of Donatello's Judith. The group is indebted to Giambologna's study of Hellenistic sculpture, particularly in the voids which penetrate the three interlocked figures. On a technical level it represents the fullfilment of an aspiration from antiquity. Ancient sources record sculptures made from a single block, a claim which the Renaissance discovered was not true. Giambologna intended to surpass antiquity by sculpting a large group from a single block that also involved a complicated lift. The result is the first sculpture with no principal viewpoints, it forms a spiral that is the culmination of the \"figura serpentina\".\n",

      "The tradition of Master HonorÃ© was probably continued by his son-in-law Richard of Verdun who is known to have been employed by the Ste Chapelle in 1318. However, no books have survived which can be attributed to him. The next royal illuminator whose work is identifiable was Jean Pucelle. He is mentioned in documents between 1319 and 1327, however, books attributable to him (more than a dozen) exist up to the middle years of the century.The Belleville Breviary comes from the workshop of Jean Pucelle. Pucelle's style is close to that of HonorÃ©. The d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry has the same soft modelling and in Pucelle's presumed early work faces and hands are delicate and pallid. Nevertheless, a great many new features appear. The page from the Belleville Breviary reveals a wide range of decorative invention embracing naturalistic flowers, insects, birds and animals and grotesque little men playing musical instruments. But the whole effect is tightly controlled, associated as it is with a firm regular framework of narrow bars.The influence of Italian painting is marked in Pucelle's work, demonstrated by his interest in pictorial space. This is possibly the most revolutionary feature of his work. The exploitation of various rudimentary forms of perspective was a completely new feature of late thirteenth-century Italian painting, and Pucelle incorporated something of these experiments into his manuscript illuminations.The page (folio 24v) from the Belleville Breviary shows David and Saul enclosed within a small doll's-house-like construction, painted erratically but clearly in three dimensions. Below (on the bas-de-page) the scene of Cain murdering his brother is depicted.\n",

      "The work (12 panels) was commissioned in 1453, when the artist was twenty-two years old, for the chapel of S. Luca in the church of S. Giustina, Padua. The figures represented, reading from upper left, are: St Daniel of Padua, St Jerome, the Virgin, Christ, St John, St Augustine, St Sebastian, St Scolastica, St Prosdocimus, St Benedict and St Justina.The original wooden frame in which Mantegna's signature had been incised was destroyed by lightning in the seventeenth century. Its loss radically alters the composition, as can be seen by the considerable difference in scale between the two registers. It is thus worth attempting a reconstruction, in order to grasp the meaning of the whole work.Probably commissioned by the donors to execute a Gothic-type altarpiece, Mantegna must have succeeded in altering the scheme substantially by inserting a thick molding between the two orders. This division set the two ranges much farther apart than they are today. Another device used by the artist to avoid the effect of caged images is the perspective in the centre of the composition whereby the upper panels were made smaller to suggest distance while the lower panels were made larger to imply that they are closer to the spectator. But the most sensational means is the stepped pavement, which must have been the ground plane of the suggested architectural construction. The whole must have made a sort of two-storied loggia, housing figures engaged in a Sacra Conversazione.Even without its original framework, the separate figures remain highly impressive. A lyric quality, unequalled in Mantegna's other work, is generated by the illusionistic effect of the figures, achieved by means of their \"wet d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry,\" which Mantegna must have rediscovered by studying classic Roman sculpture.\n",

      "The Virgin, depicted here with flowing, fair hair, is seated before a red backcloth in a landscape, while two angels hold a garland of roses over her head. The Child is shown playing with a siskin and holding a sugar-castor in his right hand. The Madonna's left hand rests on a book, and with the other she takes a spray of lily of the valley which the young Saint John is holding out to her.On a wooden bench in the foreground lies a piece of paper bearing the painter's signature in Latin : `Albertus durer germanus faciebat post virginis partum 1506'. That DÃ¼rer should here describe himself specifically as German is not surprising when one takes into account his admiration for the Italian artists. He has included quite a few Venetian touches in this picture and was obviously proud of his achievement. The type of half-length figure he has adopted for the Madonna is modelled on southern paintings and the characteristic blue and red colour-scheme is adopted from Giovanni Bellini, whom DÃ¼rer, as he wrote in a letter to Nuremberg at the time, regarded as `the best of all painters'. The flying cherubim, bodyless angels, were also derived from the Italian Renaissance masters. Saint John, presenting the flowers, is closely akin to the small figure in Titian's Madonna of the Cherries in the Vienna Gallery, which was not painted until the second decade of the century. Here the Venetian master showed his respect for the German artist.Quite a lot is known about DÃ¼rer's visit to Venice in 1506. He received a major commission from the German merchants at the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, who later also commissioned works from Giorgione and Titian; DÃ¼rer's work, the Festival of the Rosary, now in Prague, proved a difficult task which kept him busy and preoccupied for a long time, as he himself admitted; as a result he lost other commissions. He had only the last quarter of the year 1506 in which to complete the Madonna with the Siskin, for the following spring he returned to Nuremberg; thus it became an Italian Christmas picture, as the inscription `after the confinement of the Virgin' expressly states. There are four extant studies for this painting, in which the Child, the cherubim and a piece of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry are portrayed (Bremen, Paris, Vienna). These sketches also show how closely the creation of the Berlin panel was linked with the Festival of the Rosary.Painted for an unknown patron, the work was probably in the palace of Rudolf II in Prague, assuming that Carel van Mander's description of 1618 - `a Madonna, over whom two angels hold a garland of roses, with which to crown her' - refers to this painting. How it came from Italy to Prague is as much a mystery as its subsequent movements. In the 1860s the panel was rediscovered in Scotland; it was in Newbattle Abbey near Edinburgh in 1892 when it was acquired for the Berlin Gallery from the Marquess of Lothian.\n"

In some portraits he applies the English convention directly, but in most cases he combines elements from it with other devices. For instance, in the portrait of a tutor and his pupil, the angular d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries of the pupil and the schematic drawing of his face belong to the English convention, whereas the head of the tutor is in a quite different vein of naturalism, suggesting rather a knowledge of Dutch painting. The pattern itself, with the two figures cut off at three-quarter-length, is a formula derived from Van Dyck and much favoured by his English followers. But the affectation of the boy's pose and the unexpected placing of the dog in the foreground, facing into the composition, distinguish the painting from English models.This painting is an outstanding example of French portraiture from the last quarter of the seventeenth century.

      "Pierre Mignard, known in his native France as Le Romain, lived in Rome from 1636 (visiting Venice and other northern Italian cities in 1654-5) until summoned home by King Louis XIV in 1657. His style was largely based on Annibale Carracci, Domenichino and Poussin. However, he pretended allegiance to Titian and Venetian colourism on his return to France, mainly to oppose his rival Lebrun, whom he succeeded in 1690 as First Painter to the King and Director of the Royal Academy. Despite all his years abroad, his work looks to us unmistakably French, at least as relating to the France of the Sun King's court: calculated and grand. Hogarth's xenophobic English jjudgment, half a century later, might apply to this superb portrait: 'insolence with an affectation of politeness'. But Mignard was doing no more than following the wishes of his sitter, the widow of Jean-Baptiste Colbert de Seignelay, Minister for the Navy.Catherine-ThÃ©rÃ¨se de Matignon, Marquise de Lonray, veuve de Seignelay, instructed Mignard to portray her as the sea-nymph Thetis, to whom was said (according to Ovid's Metamorphoses XI, 221-3): 'O goddess of the waves, conceive: thou shalt be the mother of a youth who, when to manhood grown, shall outdo his father's deeds and shall be called greater than he.' Past writers have attributed Mme de Seignelay's transformation into a sea goddess to her husband's office, but it was shown that this passage from Ovid is the key to the portrait. Like Thetis, Mlle de Matignon, of old Norman nobility, had been married off against her will to a social inferior: Colbert, her husband's father and the great Minister of the King, was the son of a d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>r. The goddess's husband, Peleus, had to <font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> Thetis to 'beget on her the great Achilles', the most celebrated Greek hero of the Trojan War. 'The hero's mother, goddess of the sea, was ambitious for her son' and by descending into the fiery crater of Etna, the volcano seen here smoking in the background, obtained for him armour made by Vulcan, the blacksmith god. This is the armour, 'work of heavenly art', worn in the guise of Achilles by Marie-Jean-Baptiste de Seignelay, the eldest son for whom Mme de Seignelay had just bought a military commission.The painting's brilliant effect depends in large measure on the vast expanse of Thetis' best ultramarine-blue cloak, contrasting wonderfully with the coral and pearls in her hair, and the mauves and greens of Achilles' garments. Ultramarine was the costliest of pigments, more expensive than gold itself and for that reason seldom used by this date, and never in such quantities. Thus did Mme de Seignelay confound the rumours put about by 'mauvaises langues' that she was bankrupt. And there is more: other rumours circulated that the noble widow either was, or wished to be, mistress to the king. The Cupid proffering a precious nautilus shell brimming over with a king's ransom in jewels publicises the liaison as a fait accompli. Thus might a classical education, and the talents of a Roman-trained and responsive artist, be put to insolent use 'with an affectation of politeness'.\n",

The immediate source is Ribera's own print of 1621, which has been altered to heighten the dramatic impact of the angel, who rouses the saint from his studies by sounding the trumpet of the Last Judgment. More important is the level of technical maturity, as evinced in the richly textured brushwork that enlivens every square millimetre of the surface. The powerful contrast of light and shadow produces what contemporary theorists most admired about Ribera's painting - his \"relievo,\" that ability to make two-dimensional objects seem as if they were projecting outward from the canvas. The brilliant red d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry over the saint's leg also provides the composition with an electrifying accent.\n"

      "Bishop Neon decorated the interior with mosaics, dividing the interior surface into three zones of decoration.In the lowest zone eight columns are set into the corners and support arches decorated with mosaics of the Prophets. Mosaic inscriptions and marble revetment alternately fill the wall-spaces beneath the arches.In the second zone stucco arcades that may date from the building's foundation frame both the windows and the stucco aediculae that contain figures of 16 minor Prophets. This is in contrast to the absence of plastic articulation in the 6th-century churches of San Vitale and Sant'Apollinare Nuovo.Finally, the mosaic in the dome is divided into two rings and a central medallion. The outer ring contains an architectural frieze of eight compartments that alternately enclose altars and thrones. In the inner ring two files of Apostles, led by Sts Peter and Paul and carrying golden crowns, move between garlands of flowers and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d curtains. In the centre of the dome above is a medallion depicting the Baptism.The composition of the dome mosaics reflects the emergent principles of Byzantine art in which architectural space is used as a unifying element in decoration. The two outer rings produce an effect of spatial illusion, and their airy quality is reminiscent of the mosaics in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia.Although the Baptism is dominated by its gold ground, the use of gold in the lower zones blends harmoniously with the other colours. The exquisite colour scheme of the Apostles' costumes, their tunics and mantles being gold and blue–white in an alternating sequence, exhibits a varied use of colour that is lost in later developments. On the columns in the ring below run stripes of gold tesserae, almost invisible to the eye but conferring a strong and shimmering light to the architectural scenery.\n",

      "The figures are seen in a vaulted portico opening onto an inner garden. The space is situated in a fortress raised above earthly life, the city below and the river landscape. Seated on the step of a wooden throne, over which a canopy is hung, the Virgin is suckling the Child. St Luke sits in front of her. With one knee resting on a cushion, he is drawing her portrait with a silver point on a sheet of paper or parchment supported by a small plank. The Virgin's head and features have already been worked out. The drawing is intended as a preparatory sketch, which causes the theme to be interpreted as taking place in real time, as well as emphasizing the artist's ability to record the divine, and thus, as it were, to prove its existence. The activity depicted in the painting probably reflects accurately the way in which, in the fifteenth century, a painted portrait was prepared by means of a preliminary drawing (the best-known example is Van Eyck's drawing with the portrait of Cardinal Albergati in Dresden). In the adjacent room behind St Luke lies an open book, probably an allusion to his gospel, and the ox, his emblem. It remains unclear why the scroll is not inscribed with his name.The low position of the Virgin, seated in front of her throne, corresponds to the type of the Virgin of Humility, a motif derived from St Luke's Gospel. On the arm of the throne the Fall of Man is depicted, which is connected with the role of Jesus and Mary as the new Adam and Eve. The two small figures looking over the crenellated wall are sometimes linked with Joachim and Anna, Mary's parents. In the background on the left is a wooden corner-house with a signboard consisting of a stick on which copper dishes are hanging. More of these can also be seen in the display-window. This same house often appears in the work of Rogier van der Weyden and the Master of FlÃ©malle and it has been erroneously taken for a shop of painters' materials. In fact it concerns a surgeon's house. The pans were used during blood-letting. In the context of this painting the connection with the figure of St Luke, who was also a doctor, is not imaginary. His clothing too, with the exception of the evangelist's inkpot hanging from his belt, is in fact that of a doctor.St Luke as the portrait painter of the Virgin was originally probably intended to be symbolical, because his gospel deals with the Virgin Mary in the greatest detail. In his capacity as an artist, he came to be the patron saint of the painters' guilds from the fourteenth century onwards. The composition is the oldest preserved example of a St Luke painting the portrait of an actually present Mother of God.There exist three other examples of this composition, identical apart from a few details, of which the one in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, since its restoration in 1932-33, is regarded by most art historians as the original (other examples in Munich, Alte Pinakothek, and St Petersburg, Hermitage). The attribution to Rogier van der Weyden was made on stylistic grounds and has never been contested. The date, on account of the still strong link with the Master of FlÃ©malle (emphasis on materiality and volume, rounded, broad, rolling d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry) and the resemblance to Jan van Eyck's Virgin of Chancellor Rolin (Paris, MusÃ©e du Louvre), has been situated in his early period (1435-36). To judge by the technique the examples of Bruges, Munich and St Petersburg were only made towards the end of the fifteenth or even in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Although they are very faithful copies, they appear on comparison each to have a style of its own with occasionally a remarkable kinship with well-known Brussels painters such as the Magdalene Master (St Petersburg) and of the Master of the Embroidered Foliage (Munich). The Bruges version is more difficult to situate. It seems to be of higher quality than the copies of Munich and St Petersburg, and is certainly the best preserved.The composition was enormously popular in the second half of the fifteenth century, when the abundant production of half-length Virgins started to undergo its morphological influence. It gave rise to a host of pastiche-like borrowings of loose elements. Hans Memling was inspired by the architectural setting and the background of Rogier's painting when creating his Virgin Enthroned of Kansas City.\n",

      "Originally, the work was entitled G<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> Harvest at Arles, but Gauguin later renamed it Human Anguish, lest its symbolic connotations be overlooked. The pose of the crouching female figure in the foreground was a direct quotation from a Peruvian mummy that Gauguin had seen in the ethnographic museum in Paris, and which was to recur in later works, most notably in Where Do We Come From. Her pose evokes grief and guilt, perhaps sexual guilt, ironically referred to in the abundance of the harvest which surrounds her. Indeed, the backdrop of the harvest is treated like water, with the suggestion of frothy waves in the foreground, which for Gauguin represented female sexual abandonment. The picture may be meant to evoke a post-seduction scene, a theme which Gauguin explored to its fullest in The Loss of Virginity.That the scene, painted at the beginning of November 1888, was executed from the imagination and not from life is evident from the fact that the scene is peopled with Breton peasant women whom Gauguin could not have seen for several months.\n",

The simple surface divisions of his earlier work have been replaced by representations of fully three-dimensional architecture. The grandiose barrel vault of sculptured profiles, set in medallions in the tympanums, shows the influence of Bramante. The fullness of the compositional forms and their spectacular effect, as well as the triumphant character of the Madonna, reveal Foppa's intimate lyric qualities.

      "The predella panel with five scenes illustrates episodes from the Saint's life. The predella scenes are much more lively and realistic than the main panel; their animated narrative quality is more like the St Martin cycle.From left to right, in the first panel we find Louis accepting the nomination to Bishop of Toulouse on condition that he be allowed to enter the Franciscan Order. This event took place in secret in Rome in December 1296, in the presence of Boniface VIII; Louis's father, Charles II, for political reasons wanted his son to become Bishop of Toulouse, for he needed to have direct control over an area that was particularly important for the King of France, Philip the Fair. And who could be a more trustworthy Bishop than his own son? But Louis had already given up his throne in order to follow the example of St Francis, and he had no intention now of becoming a pawn in a political manoeuvre, for this went against his spiritual aspirations; so, in return for accepting this religious office (which was not religious at all. . . ), he requested to be allowed to enter the Franciscan Order.In the following panel Louis publicly takes his vows and is consecrated Bishop: this is the official conclusion, on 5 February 1297, of the secret agreement made between Pope Boniface and the Saint.The third scene is based on the proceedings for the canonization of Louis in 1308: with great modesty, the Bishop Saint served and fed the hungry. These scenes relate perfectly to the subject-matter of the altarpiece, the coronation of King Robert, for they exalt the humility of Louis: he is humble because he gave up his throne, he is humble in the presence of Boniface VIII, he is humble in his daily life. But the truth was different. Even more important than his humility, Louis was poor: poor like St Francis, poor like the unpopular Spirituals, and above all poor unlike a King's son, especially one who was a Bishop and had just been canonized. The patron who commissioned the painting (Robert of Anjou, Mary of Hungary, or any other member of the royal family) clearly requested Simone to conceal, or at least not to emphasize, this aspect of the Saint's virtue; he was to celebrate another aspect of it, equally valid from a spiritual point of view, and totally innocuous politically: Louis is a follower of Christ in his humility, not in his poverty.After the scene of Louis's Funeral, depicted as a magnificent ceremony worthy of a high prelate (actually, it appears that it was an austere and simple service), in the last panel we find the scene of a miracle involving a small child: a man prays with a statuette of St Louis in his hands asking for his intervention and his child, who had died shortly before, miraculously comes back to life. With its lively narrative quality and especially because of the iconography involving the death of a child, this scene is very similar to the episodes depicted in the altarpiece of the Blessed Agostino Novello.The spatial construction of the altarpiece, both in the main panel and in the predella scenes, shows a very conscious elaboration of Giotto's methods, which Simone had already used in the Assisi frescoes. The d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry of the cope, the lion's feet on the faldstool half-hidden by the dais, the geometric patterns on the carpet, as well as the arcades, loggias and the shadowy areas in the episodes below, are the product of very subtle perspective observations which reveal to what extent Simone had by this stage developed a mature approach to spatial construction and the reproduction of volumes.\n",

The two outer rings produce an effect of spatial illusion, and their airy quality is reminiscent of the mosaics in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia.Although the Baptism is dominated by its gold ground, the use of gold in the lower zones blends harmoniously with the other colours. The exquisite colour scheme of the Apostles' costumes, their tunics and mantles being gold and blue–white in an alternating sequence, exhibits a varied use of colour that is lost in later developments. On the columns in the ring below run stripes of gold tesserae, almost invisible to the eye but conferring a strong and shimmering light to the architectural scenery.\n",

      "Titian's early series of female portraits are one of the glories of the Venetian Renaissance. Depicted with loving care, his sitters - however idealized in the final composition - are too full of life and character not to have been taken from the model.The Woman with a Mirror is probably among the earliest of these works: in comparison to others in the series, she is seen from a more frontal angle behind the pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>t and in terms of atmosphere appears less integrated within the ambient space. She stands between two mirrors held up by an admirer in such a way that she can see herself and her admirer and we can see her from both front and back. This arrangement refers to the claims of painting to surpass sculpture, by presenting an all-round view with colour as a bonus. Her expression has little to do with vanity, a common gloss on images of women before a mirror, and shows an unaffected and dawning delight in her own attractions which the viewer, like her admirer, is expected to share. Thus the picture is a celebration of her beauty, enhanced by the possibility of its being admired from different aspects by all concerned - herself, her lover and the spectator.\n",

      "De Witte was born in Alkmaar, the son of a schoolmaster. He worked in Delft and entered the Delft guild in 1642. By 1652 he settled in Amsterdam where he spent the rest of his life.In Amsterdam de Witte continued to paint views of Delft churches, but he was inspired more often by the metropolis's grand buildings: its Old Church, lofty New Church, Stock Exchange, and, after it was consecrated in 1675, its Portuguese-Jewish Synagogue.This synagogue was built between 1671 and 1675 for the Spanish and Portuguese (Sephardic) Jews who as of the end of the sixteenth century had settled in Amsterdam where they could profess their faith in relative freedom. In this respect the synagogue symbolizes the tolerant religious climate in the Republic of the United Netherlands. De Witte portrayed the synagogue during a service, with believers wearing hats d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d with pale yellow talliths, or fringed prayer shawls. To the left of middle is the teba, or bimah (the platform in the middle of a synagogue from where the Torah is read), with on it the cantor and the parnas, or synagogue president, and against the back wall the Hechal, or Holy Ark.It is known from contemporary sources that the synagogue was considered a sight worth seeing. This is confirmed in the present painting: most of the figures in the foreground are non-Jewish visitors.The synagogue features more often in paintings, but only its exterior and as part of a city view. In so far as is known, De Witte is the only seventeenth-century painter to have portrayed the interior of this building. He did it at least three times.\n"

Here, he is propping his left elbow on some white d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, has straightened out his left leg behind him, and is supporting his bent right leg by gripping the toes. A magnificent piece of red fabric provides pictorial ornament, at the bottom on the left. The Baptist's body is so firmly embedded in the yielding hide of his coarse garment that the energetically black contours from his upper thigh to his back stand out in a clear flow of lines. With his right arm, the boy is reaching for a ram which has suddenly materialized from the depth of the picture. Its nose and mouth are nearly touching the smiling boy's cheek.Caravaggio clearly based the figure on Michelangelo's example, though he painted it according to his own principles of working direct from a living model. The figure does not reveal the great Florentine's feeling for musculature, but the vigorous contouring of his back shows his influence. Caravaggio is likely to have used a study here. With great skill and his instinct for dynamic action, Caravaggio has placed the carefully built-up body in such a way that the figure's left elbow almost bumps against the edge of the picture. Otherwise, however, the figure is completely free. This enables the apparition in the light to develop dynamically from top left towards the right.\n",

      "Manfredi's picture has been interpreted as an allegory of the Four Seasons, linked to the iconography of the Five Senses and explained as the four ages of man exemplified by various phases of love. There can be little doubt that its primary theme is the Four Seasons. The four figures, crowded behind a stone slab laden with fruit, are clearly identifiable as Spring (a young woman crowned with roses and playing a lute), Autumn (the young man adorned with a Bacchic crown of g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s), Summer (a bare-breasted woman who turns and stares directly at the viewer) and Winter (a shivering old man in a fur hat who is wrapped in a blanket). Nevertheless, their arrangement does not suggest the normal progression of the year and their interaction suggests a second level of meaning.The rich array of fruit carefully placed before the figures is composed entirely of autumnal produce: g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s, pears, apples, figs, a pomegranate and a squash. This is clearly the domain of Autumn, who kisses the lute-playing Spring but at the same time embraces Summer, who wears a sprig of his wheat in her hair. Summer holds a small round transparent mirror as a symbol of the Origin of Love. Autumn's kiss and embrace signify that music is born of love, while Winter's exclusion is a sad reminder that in old age one is less inclined towards amorous sentiments.Manfredi's facial features and tightly compressed composition find close parallels in Caravaggio's Musicians. The brightly illuminated fruit, so carefully displayed on cold, grey stone, and Summer's frank confrontation of the viewer over her bare shoulder seem to recall Caravaggio's Sick Bacchus explicitly. Although two other versions of Manfredi's Four Seasons are known, he painted no other allegoric subjects.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 43 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/18_cent/vivaldi_4seasons.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Vivaldi: Four Seasons, violin concertos op. 8 Nos. 1-4</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

      "The work (12 panels) was commissioned in 1453, when the artist was twenty-two years old, for the chapel of S. Luca in the church of S. Giustina, Padua. The figures represented, reading from upper left, are: St Daniel of Padua, St Jerome, the Virgin, Christ, St John, St Augustine, St Sebastian, St Scolastica, St Prosdocimus, St Benedict and St Justina.The original wooden frame in which Mantegna's signature had been incised was destroyed by lightning in the seventeenth century. Its loss radically alters the composition, as can be seen by the considerable difference in scale between the two registers. It is thus worth attempting a reconstruction, in order to grasp the meaning of the whole work.Probably commissioned by the donors to execute a Gothic-type altarpiece, Mantegna must have succeeded in altering the scheme substantially by inserting a thick molding between the two orders. This division set the two ranges much farther apart than they are today. Another device used by the artist to avoid the effect of caged images is the perspective in the centre of the composition whereby the upper panels were made smaller to suggest distance while the lower panels were made larger to imply that they are closer to the spectator. But the most sensational means is the stepped pavement, which must have been the ground plane of the suggested architectural construction. The whole must have made a sort of two-storied loggia, housing figures engaged in a Sacra Conversazione.Even without its original framework, the separate figures remain highly impressive. A lyric quality, unequalled in Mantegna's other work, is generated by the illusionistic effect of the figures, achieved by means of their \"wet d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry,\" which Mantegna must have rediscovered by studying classic Roman sculpture.\n"

This deed secured the legendary Roman lady a place in the series of exemplary females that in European  painting, particularly in court circles, were depicted as examples of virtue.In most paintings of this subject Lucretia is nude, which gives a sly erotic undertone to the situation, but Rembrandt shows her robed to the neck in fine clothes, like the noblewoman she was.

Although her body remains upright she lurches sideways from the hips as she clutches the bell-rope, and her face has the pallor of approaching death.The motif of the hand clasping the tasselled rope, however, is a reminder of the common studio practice whereby a model posing with his or her arm raised would support it by means of a rope or sling.\n",

      "The Annunciation in Santa Croce is the first work to reflect Donatello's new tendencies following his stay in Rome. \"It was put near the altar of the Cavalcanti Chapel. For this he made an ornament in the grotesque style, with a base of varied and intertwined work, surmounted by a quartercircle, and with six putti; these garlanded putti have their arms round each other as if they are afraid of the height and are trying to steady themselves. Donatello's ingenuity and skill are specially apparent in the figure of the Virgin herself: frightened by the unexpected appearance of the angel she makes a modest reverence with a charming, timid movement, turning with exquisite grace towards him as he makes his salutation. The Virgin's movement and expression reveal both her humility and the gratitude appropriate to an unexpected gift, particularly a gift as great as this. Moreover, Donatello created a masterly flow of folds and curves in the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries of the Madonna and angel, suggesting the form of the nude figures and showing how he was striving to recover the beauty of the ancients, which had been lost for so many years. He displayed such skill and facility that, in short, no one could have bettered his design, his jjudgment, his use of the chisel, or his execution of the work.\" (Vasari).The setting is elaborately classical - though the composition recalls iconographical precedents of the 14th century - and is richly decorated with lavish gilding on stone. The composition conveys a strong impression of the episode of the Annunciation: of an unlooked for gift received with serene grace. Other works of this period are inspired by an entirely different spirit.\n",

      "In the culinary culture of the aristocracy and the patrician middle classes, banquets consisted of six to eight - sometimes even nine - courses and were always concluded by a dessert. Interest in desserts came to a climax at a time when numerous delicacies had been introduced as new luxuries. This was especially true for sugar confectionary, which appeared in still-lifes around 1600 for the first time. The introduction of sugar marked a radical revolution of taste. Initially it was only used for pharmaceutical purposes, but it soon replaced honey as a sweetener and a food.The crystalline structure of the candied sugar was rendered especially accurately by Georg Flegel in his confectionary still-life. His painting shows candied fruit on a table in the foreground, including two figs on the right, encrusted with large sugar crystals. Some of the fruits have been cut up in the shape of letters, for example a large 'O' can be made out as well as a crumbled 'A' beside the loaf of bread. A straight piece of sugar is lying across the loaf like a cross-beam and is being approached by a disproportionately large bee. The earthenware bowl with the blue pattern contains candied fruit dusted with icing sugar, and a brimstone butterfly, whose wings also show traces of sugar, has alighted on it.Flegel added a religious dimension, because the seemingly innocuous arrangement is full of Christian allusions. For example, the letters 'A' and 'O' (Alpha and Omega) as the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet are a reference to Apocalypse 1:8 and 21:6, where Christ is referred to as the beginning and the end. The cross formed by the loaf and the piece of sugar emphasizes this aspect even further. Finally, as a reminder of the Eucharist, there is the bread and wine in the dainty glass, with decorations resembling amphora handles which drop down in the form of g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>-like clusters at the bottom. The redemptive work of Christ is called to mind by the butterfly, an ancient symbol of the human soul as well of the resurrection, as new life comes forth from a seemingly dead chrysalis. The heart on the right is a specially shaped piece of bread, made from communion wafer dough, and is apparently meant to remind the viewer of the heart of Christ.In Flegel's art, sugar has entirely taken over the religious connotations of honey, which was understood as a symbol of 'spiritual sweetness' during the Middle ages.\n",

Following the perspective around, the beholder's gaze is led by the spiral line of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry in a perpetual transformation of physical substance to the point of complete dematerialization. In the rear view, the figure appears merely as the shape of a cloud floating on the sky.A monumental version in bronze, which was not executed, was probably based on this figure, and would have been conceived as part of a spatially expansive ensemble.\n",

The 112-metre-high Dom Tower is the hallmark of the city. In 1674 the central portion of the cathedral with the nave collapsed in a storm. The tornado split the cathedral in two.

      "In 1532, Michelangelo was 57 when he met the 17-year-old Tommaso dei Cavalieri, who came from a well-respected patrician family. The artist was immediately and utterly smitten by the youth's beauty, distinguished appearance, and intellect, and their meeting marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship. Michelangelo sent Tommaso sonnets, letters, and drawings, in which he expressed his love for him. He promoted the young man's artistic interest by teaching him how to draw and by imparting architectural knowledge to him.Michelangelo presented as a gift to Tommaso a series of drawings on classical-mythological themes. These included The <font color=\"ff0000\">Rape</font> of Ganymede, The Punishment of Tityus, The Fall of Phaethon. All these heroes symbolized the \"fire that burned in him\". According to Vasari, the master created many other drawings for Tommaso, among them the \"divine heads\" in black and red chalk, such as the portrait of Cleopatra.This drawing in the Fogg Art Museum is considered by many scholars to be one of the many copies made after Michelangelo's original design.Ganymede was a shepherd, the son of Tros, a legendary king of Troy. His outstanding beauty caused Jupiter to fall in love with him. According to Ovid (Met. 10: 152-161) the god, having transformed himself into an eagle, carried the youth off to Olympus where he made him his cup-bearer. The myth, which is given in a slightly different version by Homer, found favour in ancient Greece because it appeared to provide religious sanction for homosexual love.\n",

      "The masterly portrait bust is the only surviving part of the mausoleum of Jacobus Franciscus van Caverson and his wife, Johanna Schockaert, which once stood in the former Dominican church in Brussels. The monument was demolished at the end of the 18th century. All the other elements apart from the bust were then lost, having been mentioned together for the last time in the Brussels auction catalogue of 1820. The composition is also known to us through an engraving in Jacobus Le Roy's Le Grand thÃ©atre sacrÃ© du DuchÃ© de Brabant (1734) and by a small number of designs preceding the completion of the grave. Above a tomb with the funerary text stands, on a base, a portrait of the deceased, flanked to the left and right by two stately seated female figures, Fortitude and Prudence, a reference to Caverson's motto: Fortiter et prudenter. On the fronton Saturn is depicted, his left arm resting on an hourglass and pointing with his right hand to the words Prope est. The architectural conception of the monument is classical: the tomb is decorated with two consoles, and in front of and next to the two Corinthian pilasters hang the sixteen quarters of the two deceased, whilst their helmeted coats of arms are set up under the fronton.Judging from the engraving this was an impressive composition, the loss of which is to be lamented. Fortunately the well preserved remaining bust is proof of Michiel van der Voort's skill and mastery. Although the sculptor represents his model realistically with deep eye sockets, sunken cheeks, narrow, pressed lips and a prominent nose, he does not impair either the bearing or the worthiness of Caverson, speaker of the second chamber of the Council of Brabant and member of the Privy Council and the Council of State. The imposing Regency wig and the virtuously d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d toga further emphasis the magistrate's dignity. One may assume that Michiel van der Voort received the commission for the Brussels funerary monument around 1713, the year of Caverson's death. Right then he was at the peak of his career as a highly productive artist and had just completed the pulpit for St Bernard's Abbey in Hemiksem with its Four Continents, which now stands in Antwerp Cathedral.\n",

      "This painting is one of a small number of important early candlelit subject paintings, all of which were painted in the late 1760s and early 1770s before he travelled to Italy, which both established the artist's contemporary celebrity and for which he is most famous today.The painting depicts six young draughtsmen, in various stages of adolescence, grouped around an antique marble statue known as the Borghese Nymph with a Shell, which dominates the composition. A first century Roman marble that was rediscovered during the Renaissance, it was much admired in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In Wright's day the original was housed at the Villa Borghese, in Rome, and it is now in the Louvre. In the early 1730s a marble copy of the statue was brought to England from Rome by the sculptor Peter Scheemakers, and it may be this that served as the model for Wright's painting. A symbol of carefree childhood and a model of idealised beauty, it was heavily influential on artists across Europe.The scene is dramatically lit by a single oil lamp, hidden from view behind the red d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> that hangs down in the upper left of the composition. Its warm glow illuminates the statue, lending an almost warm fleshiness and a soft sensuality to the cold marble, whilst also picking out the ruddy features of the students themselves and throwing them into high relief.There is another version, painted c. 1769, which has a number of significant changes to the composition. It is now in the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven.\n",

      "In France there is archaeological evidence for the continuous use and construction of separate baptismal buildings. The most famous baptistery in France, Saint-Jean at Poitiers, situated c. 100 m south of the cathedral, is the best-preserved structure to survive from Merovingian Gaul, although its origins lie in the Gallo-Roman period (4th century). In its present form it consists of a rectangular core (12.5 x 8.25 m) with a polygonal narthex on the north-west side, semicircular apses on the lateral sides, and a polygonal apse set into a t<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>zoidal projection on the south-east. The baptistery is orientated south-east, but since its lateral sides are considerably shorter than the others, they are treated like faÃ§ades and carry gables. This unusual transverse orientation was dictated by the retention of earlier constructions against the north-west face when the baptistery was rebuilt in the Merovingian period.The history of the building is extremely complex. The Merovingian campaign involved an almost complete reconstruction of the superstructure. Apses were constructed against three sides of the pre-existing building: the surviving polygonal apse on the south-east face and square apses on the lateral faces. To the north-west a rectangular chamber, preceded by two secretaria (sacristies) flanking an entrance porch, was retained from the Gallo-Roman period. The Merovingian reconstruction is not precisely dated, but it has been convincingly attributed to the episcopacy of Ansoald (674-96). Repairs apparent in the exterior facings, the transformation of the windows into oculi, the substitution of the square lateral apses for semicircular ones and the replacement of the chambers on the north-west side by a polygonal narthex have been variously attributed to the Carolingian or Romanesque periods. The two lateral apses were rebuilt in the 19th century.The patchy exterior facings have retained their Merovingian decoration, including a band of opus mixtum, pilasters with crudely carved capitals, and tympanum-, stele-, and pediment-shaped stone panels carved in shallow relief with compass-drawn rosettes, crosses, or foliate motifs.During the Middle Ages the baptistery was used as an abbey chapel and parish church, in 1836 it was transformed into a museum, a function it has fulfilled ever sinceView the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/support/plans/zzzarchi/07c/2/poitiers1.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=400,height=600');w.opener=this;w.focus();return false\">ground plan</a> of the building.\n"

      "An orphan placed in the friary as a child, Fra Filippo took his vows at Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence in 1421, in time to observe Masaccio and Masolino at work on the famous frescoes there. He was more suited to the life of a painter than to that of a Carmelite, for in 1456, while chaplain to a convent in Prato, he induced a nun to elope with him. She was to bear him a child, Filippino, who grew up to be an excellent painter of outstandingly chaste morals. Filippo was employed as an artist by the Medici, and through their intercession obtained a special dispensation to marry Filippino's mother.The Annunciation is one of a pair of panels originally from a Medici palace in Florence; the other, hanging also in the National Gallery, depicts seven saints of special significance to the family. The shape and subject matter of both panels suggest that they were part of the furnishings of two separate but related rooms, either as bed-heads or as panels situated above a bed or door. While the Seven Saints illustrates a dynastic theme through the male members of the family, the Annunciation would have been more suitable for a woman's room.The Medici device of three feathers within a diamond ring is `sculpted' in relief on the edge of the pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>t which separates the Virgin's `garden enclosed' from her bedchamber. Mary's purity is further alluded to in the lilies held by the Archangel Gabriel and those growing in the urn between them. From the centre of the arched top of the panel the hand of God the Father has launched the dove of the Holy Spirit. Its spiraling flight path, outlined in glittering gold, is about to end in the Virgin's womb from which emanates a small scattering of gold rays. In Mary's submissive pose Lippi illustrates the moment in the Gospel of Saint Luke (l: 38) when she says: `Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.'All the qualities for which the Medici prized Fra Filippo's art are demonstrated in this image. The austerity of the centralised perspective (the slope of the floor is exaggerated to account for the angle at which the panel was originally to be viewed) and of the strict geometry inherited from Masaccio is tempered by the artist's sublimely delicate use of line, colour and ornament. The Virgin's transparent veil gently softens the curve of her neck and shoulders, Gabriel's peacock wings echo the curve of the arch. But the greatest beauty of the painting resides in the meeting of angel and Virgin, virtual mirror images of each other. The one inclines his profiled head and bends his arm in gentle deference, the other responds with grave humility.\n",

      "From 1547 Goujon was principally occupied with the sculptural decoration of Lescot's new buildings at the Louvre, where the rich, allegorical system of decoration evolved for the interior of the château of Fontainebleau was for the first time extended to the full height of a faÃ§ade. Apart from repetitive architectural decoration, the principal embellishments are the magnificent female allegorical relief figures that surround the oeil-de-boeuf windows above the three doors of the south-west wing of the Cour CarrÃ©e: War, Peace, Fame, History, Victory and the Glory of the King (stone, 1547-50; in situ but restored). Although in part inspired by details from Trajan's Column in Rome (casts of which had been brought to France by Francesco Primaticcio in 1540), these figures, with their delicately carved and insubstantial d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, have the movement and exuberance of the Mannerist style.The numerous allegorical high-reliefs on the projecting bays of the attic storey of Lescot's wing of the Cour CarrÃ©e (stone, 1552-55; in situ but restored) have also disconcerted those critics who preferred to see in Goujon a purist in love with classicism. With their ample figures projecting well beyond the architectural framework, and carved in high relief, their compositions recall Rosso and Giulio Romano and demonstrate a sophisticated understanding both of Mannerist contrapposto and of the foreshortening necessary for decorative sculpture mounted high on a building. However, it is clear that by this stage in his career Goujon was increasingly helped by sculptors from his workshop.The photo shows the south part of the west wing built by Francois I. after 1546.

      "At the best site in the chapel, highly visible above the altar, are the most famous scenes of the cycle, though they are not in any way the most important stages of the stories of St Francis. In these scenes Ghirlandaio succeeded in creating his own independent and unique images. Ghirlandaio moves the scene of the represented events from Rome where they took place to Florence.The events in the Confirmation of the Rule are taking place on the most important square in Florence, the Piazza della Signoria. The fresco represents the visit of the Saint to Rome to obtain the confirmation of his order from pope Honorius III.In the centre is the consistory hall decorated with gold d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s, and with prelates and personages witnessing the pope's blessing. The Medici family are also present, honouring Sassetti. Lorenzo de' Medici the Magnificent is easily recognizable on the right side, his profile rendered unhandsome by that squashed nose which deprived him (and his mother) of any sense of taste or smell and meant that he always spoke hoarsely, and his olive-complexioned face framed by a brown shock of rather shaggy hair. To his right is Antonio Pucci, now somewhat advanced in years, and Francesco Sassetti dressed in red; his young son Teodoro is by his side.On the left, dressed in red, stand the sons of the donor: Galeazzo, Cosimo, and also Teodoro, who had already died in 1478. In order to be able to fit all figures into the picture, some of the figures that had already been painted in the fresco had to be scratched off the wall. Thus, next to the donor's sons, there appears a monk without a body: he had been overpainted, but can now be seen again shining through the insufficiently thick layer of colour that was painted over him.Coming up the steps with their tutor are Lorenzo's two elder sons, Piero and Giovanni, and with them Giulio, the orphan of Giuliano who was killed in the Pazzi conspiracy, with their blond mops of hair, the solemn face of the former and the rather vague expression of the other who follows. Their tutor is Agnolo Poliziano, a man of letters, the composer of the 'Stanze', and a friend of Lorenzo who honoured him in his house.The three boys are with Matteo Franco, the kinder and more favoured tutor, whose descriptions with the pen accompany Domenico's paint-brush that lingers with such affectionate care on the pinkish, childlike features. The same precision is repeated by Ghirlandaio in the sharp profile of Franco's sworn enemy, Luigi Pulci, a caustic and irreverent character whose soul was imbued with a violent laical paganism. Harsh, bitter, poor and melancholy, he was protected mainly by Lucrezia Tornabuoni.In the background is Florence, with its most celebrated buildings: the Loggia dei Lanzia, the faÃ§ade of Palazzo Vecchio with its solemn raised podium that was later replaced by the present-day flight of steps; the gilded Marzocco lion (symbol of Florentine democracy); a back-drop of houses in the far left-hand corner and a bell-tower (possibly that of San Piero Scheraggio) where the Uffizi would later be built. In the background is a bustling of small figures, citizens and curious onlookers, possibly an opening and closing of shutters and, in places, a glimmering of gold in the capitals and arch of the consistory hall. A faint clear light passes over the soft colours, mellowing even the severity of the stones in the distant buildings. It is the history of Florence, fixed for ever, that passes by and comes to rest in front of us.\n",

      "The Virgin is seated between two columns which stand on a low wall, probably intended as walled loggia or hall with behind it in the middle an opening flanked by columns, as Van der Weyden painted in his St Luke painting the Virgin. The situation is strongly reminiscent of the configuration of nearly all of Memling's enthroned Virgins, so that one wonders whether this drawing might not reflect the ultimate prototype of Memling's formula. This conclusion is further enhanced by the position of the Child who, seated on one of his mother's hands and gently restrained with the other, is turning sideways in an attitude of blessing. This is also Memling's basic motif.The high finish of the modelling and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries and the summary treatment of the architectural setting seem to suggest a copy drawn by the master himself of the main figure of one of his own paintings. The drawing would thus have been intended as a studio model which later ended up in Bruges workshops. It is impossible, however, to `reconstruct' Van der Weyden's lost painting from the derived versions, which are far too divergent; in some the Mother and Child are worshipped by one or two founders, in others they are surrounded by holy women or flanked by angels.The inscription 'Alberto Durer' at top left is a later addition from the 19th century.\n",

      "The miniature represents the fourth part of the visions of the Apostle St John in a framework of stylized clouds (Vision of the Throne of the Lord). With the help of an angel John is being allowed to see into Heaven. The Lord is enthroned in a huge mandorla in the centre, held up by an angel with spread wings, surrounded by the symbols of the four evangelists. On both sides of the mandorla prophets with golden crowns praise God. The seven torches symbolizing the seven souls of God were suspended by the painter on the top frame of the picture.In all probability the miniature was produced in the centre of the eastern part of the Low Countries, perhaps in LiÃ¨ge, since three different stylistic trends are blended in it. The first, the mature International Style, may have been transferred from Paris by the court art of the Northern Netherlands. It was in Paris that the aerial and yet buoyant figure of the angel with the peacock wings, who supports the mandorla, as well as the solution of the whole background originated. So did the misty, blue whirl which veils the prophets and the skies which appear like almost tangible d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry. The fullness of the shapes, the stockiness of the figures, the characteristic features of the prophets, not at all idealized, the spatially lucid representation of the steps, the gate and the throne, all point to the vigorous realism of Flemish art. And, finally, the dramatic expressiveness of German art makes itself felt in the other-worldly, eerie mood of the whole scene, in the way the white light sharply penetrates the darkness, illuminates the outlines and shines upon the sombre countenance of one prophet or the other. The encounter of these three stylistic trends is the more felicitous in the miniature as the vision, like dreams or fairytales, consists of realistic details arranged in an unrealistic manner. It is characteristic of the International Style to confront these two contrasting features, and in this picture it is combined with Flemish tendencies which are basically more naturalistic, and German ones which prefer unreality.All the same, the artist took great care to stretch the scene depicted onto the plane of the vellum, while he conveyed highly developed spatial effects as well. Thus, for example, the angel holding the mandorla is standing rather a long way from the bottom part of the frame, in the green field of the picture, whilst the point of the mandorla is in front of the top edge of the frame. Other details too jut out and are to be seen in front of the frame (St John's halo, the garment on his shoulders and the seven nails on which the seven lamps are suspended). These elements counterbalance or, as it were, eliminate the illusory effect of pictorial space.\n"

Beginning in 1459, he attempted to establish this town as a papal seat. In 1462 he rechristened it Pienza in honour of himself, rated it to a bishopric, and hired Bernardo Rossellino, who had previously been a capomaestro on Nicholas V's new apse and transepts for St Peter's and had worked in an elaborated classicising style in Florence, to transform its centre into a suitably coherent setting for the town's new status.Rosselino's plan was determined in part by pre-existing streets, by the medieval town hall at the site, and by the precipitous drop of the hill where Pius planned a new cathedral. To either side of the cathedral Rosselino placed the bishop's palace and Pius's own palace, forming a t<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>zoidal piazza.

It was El Greco's first commission upon his arrival in Toleedo in 1577. It gained great fame in Toledo, which was artistically rather archaic and provincial, and established a successful career for El Greco in the town.Here the reference is to Rome, rather than to Venice, and specifically to Michelangelo, developing the <a href=\"/html/m/michelan/1sculptu/pieta/pieta_.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/m/michelan/1sculptu/pieta/pieta_.html')\">motif of the Pietà.</a> The general scheme of the composition of the Trinity, however, refers to <a href=\"/html/d/durer/2/12/6_1520/01trinit.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/d/durer/2/12/6_1520/01trinit.html')\">DÃ¼rer's engraving</a> of the same subject. The composition continues that of the Assumption below, slowing down the upward movement which finally comes to rest in the supported shoulders of Christ. Form is more in evidence here than in the Assumption, especially in the Michelangelesque motif of the naked Christ (for which the artist probably drew inspiration from <a href=\"/html/m/michelan/4drawing/christ/2pieta.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/m/michelan/4drawing/christ/2pieta.html')\">Michelangelo's  Pietà</a> for Vittoria Colonna), and it is only later that he treats his figures with the same freedom as d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries.

      "Charles I's success in attracting Northern European painters like Rubens and Van Dyck was not matched in the field of Italian painting. The question of inviting an Italian painter was complicated primarily by the political circumstances and by religious principles. Efforts were made, for example, to attract Guercino and Albani to the English court, but the former declined on the basis that England was officially a Protestant country and that the climate was too inclement, and negotiations with the latter came to nothing. Indeed, a similar situation pertained during the reign of Charles II when the only Italian artist at court was Guercino's nephew, Benedetto Gennari, an inferior painter who worked in England from 1674. Significantly, when Orazio Gentileschi came to England in 1626 his main employer seems to have been Charles I's wife, Henrietta Maria, the daughter of Marie de' Medici, who continued to profess her Catholic faith after her marriage in 1625. For the queen Gentileschi painted the ceiling of the Great Hall in The Queen's House at Greenwich - Allegory of Peace and the Arts under the English Crown (now in Marlborough House, London) - and other important pictures by him are recorded at Greenwich such as The Finding of Moses (given by Charles I to Philip IV of Spain in 1633) and Joseph and Potiphar's Wife. This last, although sold after the king's execution in 1649, was recovered for the Royal Collection at the time of the Restoration and sent to Henrietta Maria in exile in France at Colombes.Gentileschi was born in Pisa, but early in life (1576-78) settled in Rome, where his style reflects the influence of a residual Mannerism that was soon to be swept away by the impact of Caravaggio. The artist left Rome for good at the beginning of the 1620s and is then recorded in Genoa in 1623 before moving northwards to Paris in 1624 and finally to England, where at first he worked for the Duke of Buckingham. Following Buckingham's assassination in 1628, Gentileschi became a fully-fledged court painter, indulging in diplomatic missions as well as painting. His presence in England was not widely welcomed and by 1633 he was trying to return to Florence, reminding the Grand Duke Ferdinand II in a letter that he had been out of Tuscany for fifty-five years. In spite of these efforts Gentileschi died in London.The artist's work has only recently become the subject of close study. To a certain extent his paintings are self-consciously grand and display poor draughtsmanship.Furthermore, the large scale that he so often favoured encouraged a rhetorical flourish that sometimes amounts to vacuousness. Yet many of his compositions are striking and linger in the memory - Young Woman playing a Lute (Washington, National Gallery of Art), The Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery), Lot and his Daughters (Berlin, Gemäldegalerie) or The Annunciation (Turin, Galleria Sabauda). His style would seem to be based on a fusion between the realism of Caravaggio and the clarity of exposition demanded by the Counter-Reformation. It has also been argued that paintings like Joseph and Potiphar's Wife should be seen in the context of Caroline court art. The predilection for simplified, dramatic compositions and exaggerated gesture, together with the sharp contrast between exposed flesh and the texture of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries, are paralleled in the plots of contemporary masques and poetry. Within court circles narrative pictures of this sort were possibly the province of Gentileschi, while Van Dyck concentrated at first on portraiture.The story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, which was popular in Florentine art of the early seventeenth century, is recounted in Genesis 39: 7-20. Potiphar was an Egyptian official ('captain of the body-guard') who bought Joseph from the Midianites. His wife found Joseph attractive, and after he was made comptroller of Potiphar's household she attempted to compromise Joseph but without success. 'And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hands, and fled, and got him out.' Joseph was falsely accused on the basis of the garment and eventually imprisoned. The painting exhibits the strengths and weaknesses of Gentileschi's art in that the artist recognises the dramatic potential of the scene, but cannot quite sustain it on this large scale. Interestingly, a replica (New York, Paul Drey) which is smaller in size, is in the final analysis more compelling. On the other hand, the poses of the two figures, the handling of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries and the rich colours are memorable.The painting is signed on the back of the original canvas: HORATIUS GENTILESCVs / FECIT.

      "The tomb of Pope Boniface VIII, executed by Arnolfo in St Peter's between 1294 and 1296, has reached us only fragmentarily and out of context, and the reconstruction of the whole presents many problems. The principal remains, at present in the Vatican Grottos, include two angels holding back curtains and the recumbent figure in pontificial robes on the sarcophagus, which is covered with rich d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d fabrics and embroidered with the arms of the Caetani family, repeated below in the mosaic of the plinth. Further, a series of architectural and sculptural fragments with Cosmatesque decoration of uncertain provenance survives, with further complicated attempts at reconstruction of the whole, destroyed in 1605 together with Old St peter's, but fortunately documented by a series of different sources, both graphic and documentary.Based on these, it has been possible to determine the original structure of the tomb. It took the form of a small chapel, placed behind the counter-facade of the early Christian basilica, bounded by an iron enclosure containing at its centre an altar dedicated to Pope Boniface IV (608-15). The ceiling of the chapel presented an extrados cupola decorated with at the base with a rich gallery of gables and standing on four architraved columns. Inside, on the back wall, opposite the altar and under a mosaic panel, the recumbent figure was placed n the sarcophagus between a niche framed with d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry and flanked by two curtain-holding angels.The authorship of the tomb is based on epigraphical sources, referring the mosaic to Jacopo Torriti and the definition of the structural project to Arnolfo.\n",

Elder brother to the Sistine Prophets, the Moses is also an image of Michelangelo's own aspirations, a figure in de Tolnay's words, \"trembling with indignation, having mastered the explosion of his wrath\".The Moses was executed for Michelangelo's second project for the tomb of Julius II. Inspired perhaps by the medieval conception of man as microcosm, he brought together the elements in allegorical guise: the flowing beard suggests water, the wildly twisting hair fire, the heavy d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> earth. In an ideal sense, the Moses represents also both the artist and the Pope, two personalities who had in common what is known as \"terribilità\".

      "The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Likely in charge of the entire project of the fresco decoration on the walls of the Sistine Chapel, Pietro Perugino retained for himself not only representations on the altar wall (which eventually were replaced by Michelangelo's Last Judgment) but also other significant scenes, such as Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, a most fitting subject for Pope Sixtus' chapel. The fresco is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Among his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel the Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter is stylistically the most instructive. The main figures are organized in a frieze in two tightly compressed rows close to the surface of the picture and well below the horizon. The principal group, showing Christ handing the gold and silver keys to the kneeling St Peter, is surrounded by the other Apostles, including Judas (fifth figure to the left of Christ), all with halos, together with portraits of contemporaries, including one said to be a self-portrait (fifth from the right edge). The flat, open piazza is divided by coloured stones into large foreshortened rectangles, although they are not used in defining the spatial organization. Nor is the relationship between the figures and the felicitous invention of the porticoed Temple of Salomon that dominates the picture effectively resolved. The triumphal arches at the extremities appear as superfluous antiquarian references, suitable for a Roman audience. Scattered in the middle distance are two secondary scenes from the life of Christ, including the Tribute Money on the left and the Stoning of Christ on the right.The style of the figures is dependent upon Verrocchio. The active d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group on Orsanmichele. The poses of the actors fall into a small number of basic attitudes that are consistently repeated, usually in reverse from one side to the other, signifying the use of the same cartoon. They are graceful and elegant figures who tend to stand firmly on the earth. Their heads are smallish in proportion to the rest of their bodies, and their features are delicately distilled with considerable attention to  minor detail.The octagonal temple with its ample porches that dominates the central axis must have had behind it a project created by an architect, but Perugino's treatment is like the rendering of a wooden model, painted with exactitude. The building with its arches serves as a backdrop in front of which the action unfolds. Perugino has made a significant contribution in rendering the landscape. The sense of an infinite world that stretches across the horizon is stronger than in almost any other work of his contemporaries, and the feathery trees against the cloud-filled sky with the bluish hills in the distance represent a solution that later painters would find instructive, especially Raphael.\n",

In Rome, among the most important projects were the reconstruction of the Piazza del Popolo in the north of the city and the layout of a garden on the adjacent Pincio. The first plans had been submitted to Pope Pius VI by French-trained Giuseppe Valadier in 1794. They envisaged a t<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>zoid square enclosed in colonnades. The designs were later enlarged and reworked by others. All that came of it in the end was a greatly scaled-down version by Valadier in 1816 with three-arch portico and terrace, plus the Casina erected in 1813-17 at the summit of the park.The Casina was redesigned in the Neoclassical style in the long tradition of Roman garden buildings. The various parts of the scheme - terraces, balconies, and roof superstructures, and a central Belvedere tower are assembled like pieces from a building kit. The baseless Tuscan order columns at the socle level recall the abrupt formal language of Revolutionary architecture, while the vase-topped granite Ionic columns on the main floor add a cheerful note, matching the suburban environment.\n"

      "Louise Moillon was the most significant 17th-century French painter of still-lifes. She preferred to paint fruit and flower still-lifes. She painted mostly the motif of a fruit-laden plate or - as in this case - wicker basket on a table. Her colours were always cool, and she did not undergo any significant changes.Peaches (Latin malum persicum) were regarded as a subspecies of apples in the 17th century and were associated with the same symbolism. However, it is unlikely that the artist intended any opposition between the 'Eucharistic' g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s and the peaches as a possible symbol of evil (malum). Rather, the co-occurrence of g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s and peaches was probably prompted by a theory of juices. According to this theory, peaches before a meal prevent drunkenness from excessive wine-drinking.\n",
      "https://www.wga.hu/art/p/pontormo/4capponi/1deposi.jpg\n",
      "The Deposition can perhaps justly be described as the artist's masterpiece. The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Pietà or Lamentation over the Dead Christ. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Pietà (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself. Staring at something beyond the confines of the painting and looking as though he were about to leave the pictorial space, he presents us with this complex and refined decoration of colours, forms.\n",

      "This is without doubt one of Jacob Jordaens' most magnificent compositions and one of the most successful examples of his cooperation with still-life specialist Frans Snyders. In this work, painted around 1623, a good eight years after Jordaens had become a free master, the painter is at the peak of his career. Nothing remains of the clumsiness of his youthful work. Whether the eye stays on the anatomy or the expressions of the figures, on their rhythmic ordering or their gestures, or enjoys the creamy, confident paint strokes or the alternation between the golden light and the transparent shadows, or is tempted by the rich colours of Snyders' opulent fruits: everywhere it senses the same impressive harmony.The life-size figures, allowing only a glimpse of the landscape to show through, unfold like a sculpted frieze on both sides of a female nude, seen from behind, standing slightly off centre and so introducing a certain dynamism into the composition. Her nakedness catches the full light and draws the viewer's attention. A golden glow strokes her skin, in which nothing reminds us of the cold stone from which her sculptural monumentality initially seems to originate. Rather, as a nymph she belongs, together with her female companions and the satyrs surrounding her, to the category of beings between humans, gods and animals which in antiquity embodied the untameable powers of nature. The g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s that they are all gathering possibly symbolise the rich fertility of nature. For this reason the identification of the nymph seen from behind as \"Humanity\" is not convincing. Just as unsatisfactory is the identification of the woman in a red mantle to her right as Pomona, the goddess of fruit.The cornucopia on the far right is a reference to Ovid's Metamorphoses, which tells how it came into being when the horn of Achelous, metamorphosed into a bull, broke off in his fight with Hercules. It was not Pomona but the water nymphs or naiads that afterwards filled it with fruit. In Jordaens' picture we do not, however, find the unambiguous references to Hercules and his unfortunate opponent, making it difficult to correctly title this masterpiece.\n"

Although only the rich could afford such rare artefacts, which were usually imported from distant lands, their inclusion in a painting could be interpreted as a patriotic tribute to the prosperity of Dutch trade.

While Dutch paintings of flowers, particularly tulips, clearly showed a tendency towards secularization (with noticeable emphasis on the economic and aesthetic value of flowers rather than their religious significance, Seghers tried to recover their spiritual symbolism, in accordance with the counter-reformational aims the Jesuit order.Apart from the Virgin Mary, Seghers and his pupils had a preference for Eucharistic motifs. They particularly enjoyed painting arrangements of garlands around a niche in a wall in brown hues, showing a communion chalice with a host suspended above it. The host has a mysterious luminescent quality which emphasized the process of transubtantiation (the changing of bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus). This subject was painted especially frequently by Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who was born in Utrecht but spent a considerable amount of time in Antwerp.Like Seghers, de Heem succeeded in adding a phosphorescent luminosity to his garlands, which also have an enamel-like clarity about them and richly colourful nuances. In his Eucharistic motifs they consist of fruit - particularly g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s - and bundles of grain, as well as apples, pears, figs and maize. The human eye can hardly appreciate the infinitely delicate precision of the tender, thread-like stems and little twigs winding around the jumble of the painstakingly detailed fruits.

      "Originally venerated in the convent church of Santa Maria in Campo Marzio (Rome) this painting is an icon: its miraculous powers are attested by Bombelli, in his 1792 engraving of the panel. Iconographically, the image is connected to the Constantinopolitan \"Haghiosoritissa\", a type of image in which the Virgin is represented in the act of interceding with Christ on behalf of the human race. The proposed dating of the painting to the middle of the twelfth century is generally accepted on the basis of stylistic similarities to a panel of the Last Judgment in the Pinacoteca of the Vatican Museums.Stylistically different from other Roman panels that depict the same subject, the painting has been assigned to the same hand that executed the Blessing Christ (Vatican Museums, Pinacoteca), a picture that also originally decorated Santa Maria in Campo Marzio. The two works are characterized by an accentuated linearism typical of Byzantine style and a monumental quality that is distinctly Roman. They show identical treatments of chiaroscuro effects, simplified folds of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, and effects light. Also shared by the two paintings are the brown intonations in the face, which give little concession to colorism, and certain signature characteristics like the rapid brushwork with which the artist defines the folds of Christ's neck or the dark triangle that divides the eyebrows of the Virgin.The inscription at the bottom: \"SCA VIRGO VIRGINUM\".\n"

      "According to DÃ¼rer's diary he gave away this Virgin as a present on four occasions. It is not as decidedly in the new style, but nevertheless distinguished by the new accent on frontality, exemplified by the youthful, idealized head. A peculiar impression is created by the white face and the concentration of the light on the skirt. It seems almost as if the scene were illuminated by lightning - the wind-blown hair, the creeping clouds, the upswept d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry of the angel - and in these surroundings sits the Virgin, smiling even though empty of expression, quite serene and aristocratic, idealized in the style of ancient, mild beauty. It can be noted its abstract rigidity, exemplified by the stiffly erect posture and the angular d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, in all of which it surpasses the Madonna Crowned by Two Angels.\n",

      "The diabolic enterprises represented in the triptych reach a climax in the middle panel. Devils of all species, human and grotesque, arrive from all directions by land, water and air, to converge upon a ruined tomb in the centre. On a platform before the tomb, an elegantly dressed pair have set up a table from which they dispense drink to their companions. Near by, a woman wearing a large headdress and a gown with an extravagantly long train kneels at a pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>t to offer a bowl to a figure opposite. Kneeling beside her, almost unnoticed in the midst of this hellish activity, is St Anthony himself; he turns towards the viewer, his right hand raised in blessing. His gesture is echoed by Christ half-hidden in the depths of the tomb, which Anthony has converted into a chapel. The right wall of the sanctuary ends in a decaying tower covered with monochrome scenes. Two of them, the Adoration of the Golden Calf and a group of men making offerings to an enthroned ape, are images of idolatry, while the third, the Israelites returning from Canaan with a bunch of g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s, prefigures Christ carrying the Cross on the outer wings of the triptych.A burning village illuminates the dusky background, probably a reference to the disease of ergotism or \"St Anthony's Fire\", whose victims invoked the name of St Anthony for relief. The ancient association of ergotism with the devil-plagued saint may have been influenced by the fact that one phase of the disease is characterized by hallucinations in which the sufferer believes that he is attacked by wild beasts or demons.The devils who have gathered around St Anthony display a complexity of form unusual even for Bosch. In the group far right, for example, a blasted tree trunk becomes the bonnet, torso and arms of a woman whose body terminates in a scaly lizard tail; she holds a baby and is mounted on a giant rat. Near by, a jug has been transformed into another beast of burden whose wholly unsubstantial rider bears a thistle for a head. In the water below, a man has been absorbed into the interior of a gondola-fish, his hands thrust helplessly through its sides. An armoured demon with a horse's skull for a head plays a lute at lower left; he sits astride a plucked goose who wears shoes and whose neck ends in a sheep's muzzle. All these shifting forms, moreover, display a richness of colour that confers a visual beauty on even the most disgusting shape. A recent, careful cleaning of the triptych, among Bosch's best preserved works, reveals brilliant reds and greens alternating with subtly modulated passages of blue-greys and browns.This convocation of fiends ostensibly illustrates the second attack on Anthony described in the literary accounts; the miraculous light which dispersed the devils on this occasion can be seen shining through one of the chapel windows. But the devils do not seem about to scatter \"like dust in the wind\", as one version has it, nor are they physically attacking Anthony. Instead, their torments must be understood in a spiritual sense. Like the monstrous creatures who confront Deguilleville's pilgrim, they are incarnations of the sinful urges with which Anthony wrestled in his desert solitude. In a drawing made around 1500, Albrecht DÃ¼rer similarly illustrated the evil thoughts of a group of people at Mass by means of little devils fluttering about their heads. A number of sins symbolized by Bosch's monsters can be identified, chief among which is Lust. Lust is also represented more overtly in the group of buildings at extreme right, where a monk and a prostitute drink together within a tent; there may be a further reference in the dark-skinned devil in the central group: the demon of unchastity, we are told, once appeared to Anthony in the form of a black boy. It should not be surprising that even the most ascetic saints were susceptible to this particular vice: as the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" informs us, it was through the carnal act that the Devil could most easily assail mankind.Anthony, however, has overcome all his temptations through the strength of his faith. This faith is expressed in his gesture of benediction, thought to be particularly efficacious against the Devil; and the steady gaze which the hermit directs towards us is one of comforting assurance. While the wings of the Lisbon triptych show Anthony tempted and tormented, the central panel thus shows him triumphant.\n",

      "The long-awaited heir to the throne, Prince Baltasar Carlos, born on 17 October 1629, was his parents' (Philip IV and Queen Isabel) pride and joy. While VelÃ¡zquez was in Rome he attended one of the glittering parties held in many European cities to celebrate the child's birth. No sooner was he back in Madrid than he was commissioned to paint the prince, now sixteen months old, and in another portrait of the same subject he shows the fair-haired little boy with a curious playmate. Dressed in a magnificently embroidered ceremonial robe which makes him into a miniature adult, the prince is standing on a carpeted step beneath a d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d wine-red curtain, holding a baton and a dagger in his little hands. The steel gorget indicates his future role as a military commander. His face, expressing all the charm of his French mother in childish miniature, is turned towards another child in the left foreground of the picture, and the child's abnormally large head is looking back at him.This figure is a dwarf, it is now thought probably a girl, one of the human toys so popular at many European courts of the time. The physically handicapped figure of the dwarf holds a silver rattle and an apple in imitation of an orb and sceptre, and is acting the part of a comic major-domo to the future little king. One wonders whether their Majesties and the courtiers laughed at this picture and the court painter's amusing idea.The prince's face is modelled with gentle regularity, whereas the paint is applied to the head of the female dwarf with more irregular granulation. This contrasting brushwork is often used by VelÃ¡zquez in his pictures to accentuate certain features of their content.In Spain (and other countries too) there was a long tradition of including dwarfs in royal portraits as subordinate figures. Basically, these deformed little creatures were merely attributes of the royal dignity, part of the furnishings of the court and regarded as neuter beings rather than fully human.\n",

      "The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle. In the centre of the ceiling is the much-admired oculus, opening onto a painted sky. The interplay of levels of reality elaborates ideas already set forth in his art. Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled. In the triangular spaces at the edges of the ceiling are twelve mythological scenes of Orpheus, Orion, and Hercules with backgrounds of simulated mosaics, a device that Raphael was to use in the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura. Only two of the walls have figurative narrations: the north wall with a scene that is usually called the Court and the west wall, divided into three scenes, Servants with Horse and Dogs, the Inscription with Putti, and the Meeting. The remaining two walls are painted with imitation leather d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries that encroach upon the other sides as well to create the fiction that there were curtains before all four walls and on two sides they had been opened up to reveal the events depicted.The central subject of the frescoes is Ludovico III Gonzaga, his wife, his children, and his court. A closed letter held by Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga in the Meeting seems to be the same one, now opened, that Ludovico, seated majestically, holds in the Court, and must be considered important for understanding the paintings. The style of the frescoes is similar to Mantegna's previous works. The compositions are dominated by the narrative elements, with the figures set frieze-like, close to the picture plane within a narrow spatial shelf in front of a landscape or architectural setting.\n",

      "In 1612 two landscape artists, Hercules Seghers and Esaias van de Velde joined the painters' guild in Haarlem, and it is from that year that the origins of realistic landscape painting in the north Netherlands can be dated. Esaias was born in Amsterdam in about 1590 and probably trained in the studio of Gillis van Coninxloo, an Antwerp landscape painter and follower of Pieter Bruegel the Elder; who had fled to the north as a Protestant refugee from the war in Flanders. Esaias van de Velde developed Coninxloo's style in the direction of greater realism.As can be seen in this small panel of 1623, his mature style is characterized by a striking naturalism created by free brushwork and a deliberately restricted palette. The mannerisms of Flemish landscape have disappeared to leave an image which conveys all the crispness of an icy winter day in Holland. The figures are sketched in sure, quick strokes, the landscape evoked in pigments thinly sc<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d across the still-visible gesso ground. Van de Velde also studied the work of Adam Elsheimer, the German painter who moved to Rome in the first decade of the seventeenth century. Esaias would have known Elsheimer's paintings in the form of prints and it is from them that he derives his low viewpoint and the triangular composition.At the same time as the powerful and naturalistic landscapes of Seghers and Esaias van de Velde were being created in Haarlem, Esaias's cousin, Jan van de Velde, was at work in the town engraving his delicate landscapes, and Cornelis Vroom was creating his understated but remarkably innovative paintings and prints based on the countryside around the town. Among Esaias's pupils was Jan van Goyen who was further to develop and refine his master's style.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/18_cent/vivaldi_rv297_winter.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Vivaldi: Concerto in F minor RV 297 op. 8 No. 4 (Winter)</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

After its discovery in 1865, the fresco cycle to which this work belongs was detached and progressively moved to the Brera during the late nineteenth century. At one time, the signature and date, \"Ambrosius Bergognonis 1495,\" could be read below the figure of St. Catherine.The aristocratic appearance of this female figure is based entirely on the circling patterns of the robe, which builds up an ogee form embracing vibrant spatial rhythms. These are most marked in the arm, the wheel and the somewhat heavily rendered d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry. The well-mannered monumentality is enhanced by the yellow colour.

Filippino's education was taken over by his father's pupil, Botticelli, and their association lasted many years.This painting is probably a very early work by Filippino  - some, in fact, believe it to be his earliest one to survive. At this point in his career, Filippino was still strongly under Botticelli's influence. The lyrical and graceful line - the rippling cascades of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry and the fanlike fall of cloth at the Virgin's hem - show Filippino's debt to his teacher, but the confident colours are the artist's own. As his style matured, Filippino moved away from the linearity of Botticelli. The diaphanous shimmer of fabric and sad delicacy of his faces give his works an elusive and poetic quality.The half-round shape of this painting, called a lunette, was used most often over doorways. Probably this one was placed over the entrance to a private chapel or sacristy, but its original location remains unknown.\n",

The figure is identifiable as St John only virtue of the symbols of Christ displayed in the painting: the ram (sacrificial victim), and the g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>-leaves (from whose red juice, akin to the blood of Christ, springs life); otherwise the iconographical subject (the simple, immediately apparent image) appears as a nude youth with an ironic, if not allusive, expression. Its cultivated content and its destination for an aristocratic patron are underscored by the artist's explicit use of a great figurative source of the past: Michelangelo's Ignudi from the Sistine Ceiling. But whereas Michelangelo created abstract and ideal figures with cold lights and a merely theoretical plasticism, Caravaggio models his figure on the careful observation of nature, achieving an image of perfect realism.\n",

      "The picture shows a panel of the St Thomas Altarpiece.The Virgin is seated majestically enthroned on the red coverlet, which stretches over the end of the poor shed, and her head is surrounded with a huge halo. Jesus extends His hand towards the gift of one of the old Magi who kneels reverentially before Him, but Joseph, sitting on a low stool, takes the precious treasures from the Infant. Looking at the star that has led them, the other two Magi seem to agree that they have arrived at the right place.The space of the representation is filled up by the six figures, or it is rather their massive outlines, which sometimes stand in front of each other as well as their movements that determine the space. The surroundings are just indicated: instead of allowing a view of the scenery, the mountain on the right closes the background from our sight. In terms of composition this is meant to balance the shape of the roof on the left. Thus it is the arrangement, position and movements of the six figures that give life to this carefully balanced composition. The painter stressed all the symmetrical axes of the picture, which is nearly square. The central vertical axis divides the field of the picture into two halves. The three figures of the Holy Family on the left and of the three Magi on the right are arranged in pairs by means of parallels. That is how the old King and Jesus turning towards each other correspond, as do the figures of the Virgin and of the motionless King in the centre and, finally, of Joseph and the youngest King, both of them moving, figures of whom only their half covered profiles and backs are to be seen. But, in addition to the vertical axis, the diagonal lines are also emphasized (see the lines of Joseph's leg and his right arm, the heads of the Infant and of the King in the middle, and those of the Virgin and of the kneeling King respectively). By this the composition is divided into four quarters, the painter having particularly stressed the top and bottom triangles: the former by the direct link between Joseph, Jesus and the old King and the latter by the decorative area of the red background. The regular design of the sky like a wallpaper, and the hill shaped like softly folded d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, together with the gently gathered fabrics of the garments, which hang in parallel folds, all mark this composition as belonging to the International Gothic style. The various shapes are merged into one another in unbroken curves: let us regard, for example, Joseph's right hand: his thumb is completely included in the tapering part of the reverse side of the Virgin's cloak, while his forefinger clings close to the Child's leg. The lines which sharply intersect with each other, such as the forefinger of the King in the centre, pointing to the star, are highly expressive.\n",

      "With the accession of Henry II in 1547, Goujon passed into royal service. In 1549 he collaborated with Jean Cousin the Elder in organizing the ceremonial entry of Henry II into Paris, an event that allowed the new generation of classicizing artists to display their skills. Goujon's most famous work, the Fountain of the Innocents, the architecture of which was probably by Lescot, was originally built as a monument for this occasion. It was, until 1787, a rectangular structure on a corner, presenting two arched bays to the Rue aux Fers and one to the Rue Saint-Denis. The bays were articulated by fluted composite pilasters, between which were narrow vertical relief panels of nymphs holding urns. Horizontal relief panels of tritons and nymphs were placed above and below each bay, and the spandrels of the arches were filled by winged personifications of Fame.The present appearance of the monument, as a free-standing, four-sided structure, is the result of a late 18th-century rebuilding for which Augustin Pajou provided extra sculpture in an able pastiche of Goujon's style. The vertical relief panels remain in situ, but the horizontal ones were removed around 1810 (now MusÃ©e du Louvre, Paris). All these reliefs, with their undulating contours, light, transparent d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries and finesse of execution, exude a pagan gaiety.

New details appear, to a lesser extent in the Buonconvento Madonna and repeated with greater confidence in the Crevole painting, such as the subtle play of light on the Virgin's face, over her chin and cheeks, and a clear attempt at plasticism in the folds of the garment around the face.The more carefully considered composition of the Crevole Madonna shows a faint but decided French influence: the elegant forms of the angels in the upper corners, the veiled transparency of the Child's garment, held up by a curious knotted cord, and most of all, the intimate gesture of the Infant Jesus, held in a tender embrace.\n",

      "The decoration of the Early Christian churches was mostly with mosaics. One of the most elaborate series of mosaics is in Santa Costanza, a domed circular building reputed to have been used as the burial chapel of Constantine's daughter. The mosaics are ambivalent in their imagery; the probably late Antique ones in the vaulting of the ambulatory are only Christian in that some of the motifs, such as birds pecking g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s, luxuriant foliage and birds in a garden amid vases, the g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> harvest, with putti pressing the g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s, later acquired Christian meanings.The late 4th-century mosaics in the apses of the chapels off the ambulatory represent the Christian subject of \"Traditio Legis\" (Christ giving the Law to St Paul) and \"Traditio Clavium\" (Christ giving the keys to St Peter.The picture shows the Traditio Legis. In the representation of this scene usually St Peter is the recipient of the scroll of the Law, since it was St Peter that Christ had named as the rock upon whom His Church was to be built.\n",

A little further down the slope, dressed in rags of grey, stands his young companion, playing on the castanets; a dog, prancing on its hind legs, is looking up at him. Bayeu shows a scene of beggars in a genre of poverty that has a long tradition in Spain. Yet this painting shows poverty and humility only in its objects.The composition itself is diametrically opposed to the content: the bright blue of the clothing corresponds with the bright blue of the sky. The face of the singer - the face of a martyr and a poet - is solemnly illuminated by a warm glow and the contours of his figure are sharply and clearly outlined against the background. The vibrant green of the grass, the royal blue of the clothing, the flash of a brilliant red waistcoat all combine to create a magnificently elegant sense of harmony. Because the colour of the sky is linked with that of the beggar's costume, it elevates his figure to the level of great and memorable. The handling of colour, the clarity of composition turn the figure of the blind singer into a monument. The Neoclassicist stylistic techniques present their power to monumentalise a \"lowly\" scene.\n"

In the small small picture the modelling, colour and line are precise, but there is a certain sensuality in their treatment, clearly marking the artist's Flemish origins.

Beside them and further back are two medical saints, Cosma and Damian, one of whom is holding a spatula and the other a pharmaceutical jar. The presence of these is due to the dedication of the altar, but there may also have been a personal meaning for Lotto. He was recovering from an illness between August and December 1546 when working on the altarpiece. Signs of this may perhaps also be found in the painting itself, with its simplification and poverty of inspiration, favouring the mystical moment typical of popular piety. The warm, luminous colouring, even if in subdued tones, has been recently brought back to light thanks to a masterful restoration.\n",

      "Waterhouse's The Lady of Shalott depicts a scene from Alfred Lord Tennyson's 1832 poem of the same title, in which the poet describes the plight of a young woman isolated under an undisclosed curse in a tower near King Arthur's Camelot. It is typically Pre-Raphaelite in that it illustrates a vulnerable and doomed woman and is bathed in natural early-evening light. The lady is portrayed staring away from the crucifix, which sits beside three candles. During the late nineteenth century, candles were often used to symbolise life: in this image, two have blown out.According to legend, the Lady of Shalott was forbidden to look directly at reality or the outside world; instead she was doomed to view the world through a mirror, and weave what she saw into tapestry. One day the Lady saw Sir Lancelot passing on his way in the reflection of the mirror, and dared to look out at Camelot, bringing about a curse. The lady escaped by boat during an autumn storm. As she sailed towards Camelot and certain death, she sang a lament. Her frozen body was found shortly afterwards by the knights and ladies of Camelot, one of whom is Lancelot, who prayed to God to have mercy on her soul. The tapestry she wove during her imprisonment was found d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d over the side of the boat.Waterhouse painted three different versions of this character, in 1888, 1894 and 1916.Tennyson's verse was popular with many of the Pre-Raphaelite poets and painters, and was illustrated by such artists as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Maw Egley, and William Holman Hunt. \n",

      "The story of the <font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> of Lucretia was one of the best-known episodes in the early history of Rome. It told how Sextus Tarquinius, brutal son of the tyrannical king, forced the virtuous wife Lucretia to accede to his lust by threatening that he would kill both her and her servant-boy if she refused, and afterwards claim that he had discovered them together in the act of adultery. To prevent this dishonour to her husband and family, Lucretia permitted herself to be <font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d, and was thereby able to tell her story and demand vengeance before she committed suicide.As a kind of secular saint, Lucretia was represented quite frequently in Renaissance art.

The Apollo especially is a conscious echo of Bernini. This is sculpture vigorous and robust, fully modelled, with the emphasis on action and space - the space of the open air. The pose has to be immediately effective when approached from several angles, glimpsed against a background of trees, or, as in the case of Apollo, made the centrepiece of a fountain. Just as Marly itself represented rural freedom in comparison with Versailles, so this garden sculpture escapes from any requirements of state or religion. For such sculpture, so quickly to grow weathered, a finished surface was not required. A coarser texture is responsible for the animation of surface, with bold, wind-blown d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries and muscular bodies, and with an energetic drama of expression. A momentary action, in which gestures almost speak, is seized upon, with a preference for the natural over the dignified. Guillaume's Daphne, with her desperate, gesticulating hands, looks forward to the 'natural' drama of his horses and their tamers, executed many years later.\n"

      "Bellange worked as a painter, designer of masques and graphic artist at the ducal Court at Nancy in the early years of the 17th century. Several dozen surviving drawings and a limited number of etchings testify to his brilliance in these media and show why he was held in such esteem by his patrons.Out of varied Italian and Flemish elements Bellange created a style which is intensely personal and which can be seen at its best in the etching of the Three Marys at the Sepulchre. The most immediately striking characteristics of the etching are the strange poses and forms of the three women, their long, sweeping d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries, their swan necks and tiny heads with hair strained up from the nape of the neck, and their elongated nervous fingers. The forms are those of a hyper-sophisticated court society, but the neuroticism which they display has taken a religious form, as it often did at the time of the Counter-Reformation.To create the mysterious atmosphere of his compositions Bellange uses every trick known to his predecessors. In the Three Marys, for instance, he places the three principal figures in the very foreground, but turns them round so that they all face away from the spectator and into the composition. He chooses a viewpoint so high that the ground is tipped up, and the spectator seems to be looking down on the principal figures. Bellange has sought other effects of surprise in a spirit very typical of a Mannerist; for instance, he has chosen the unusual course of representing the action as seen from the inside of the cave, and has broken the unity of time by showing the Marys twice over, once in the foreground and again in the mouth of the cave in the background.\n",

The sculptural effect of the figure is largely due to the prominence of the knees and the crossed arms, with the right elbow projecting notably and the hands folded in toward the body. This effect is heightened by the magnificent arrangement of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, especially on the left knee and over the edge of the stone seat.The meditative attitude of the old man is counterbalanced on the other side of the lunette by the fascinating spontaneity of the woman's gestures.

      "https://www.wga.hu/art/p/pontormo/4capponi/1depos.jpg\n",
      "The Deposition can perhaps justly be described as the artist's masterpiece. The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Pietà or Lamentation over the Dead Christ. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Pietà (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself. Staring at something beyond the confines of the painting and looking as though he were about to leave the pictorial space, he presents us with this complex and refined decoration of colours, forms.\n"

The body of Christ bears the stigmata of the Crucifixion. His right hand is raised in the gesture of benediction, while in the left He holds a staff surmounted by a cross. In the confined space between the sarcophagus and the enclosing fence four armed soldiers lie in a deep sleep.The Resurrection is one of the panels from a winged altar of considerable dimensions which has been lost without trace. Originally there was a carved central shrine, in which a Crucifixion group was probably represented. When the wings were closed, the altar showed four scenes relating to the Madonna; these (from top left to bottom right) were The Nativity, The Adoration of the Magi, The Descent of the Holy Ghost and The Death of the Virgin. When opened, the inner sides of the wings showed four scenes from the Passion, which flanked the central Crucifixion. Thus Christ on the Mount of Olives (top left), served as a companion-piece to Christ before Pilate (top right), while Christ bearing the Cross (bottom left), was placed opposite The Resurrection.The original location of the altar has never been established. When it was dismantled, the front and rear sides of the wings became separated. On the two lower panels of the closed altar, showing The Descent of the Holy Ghost and The Death of the Virgin, the artist appended his signature : `bitte got fÃ¼r hanssen muoltscheren vo richehove burg ze ulm haut dz werk gemacht do ma zalt MCCCXXXVII'. Records show that in 1427 the Swabian artist, who came from Reichenhafen near Leutkirch, became a burgher of Ulm, where he worked not only as a painter but more often as a sculptor and engraver. The strength and solidity of the painted figures and their remarkable realism leave one in no doubt that Multscher combined the skills of both sculptor and painter, even though, in keeping with medieval practice, he may well have made use of a well-staffed workshop.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/15_cent/dufay_easter.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

The group of mosaicists responsible for this stylistic change in decoration evidently helped to decorate Sant'Apollinare Nuovo and the Archiepiscopal chapel, which were also erected under Theodoric, and may also have had a hand in San Vitale. There can be little doubt that this group contained, or was dominated by, artisans who had been trained in the East as is suggested by the use of silver tesserae, which reflect light more sharply than those containing gold foil, and of natural stone with delicate hues for the depiction of human skin.\n",

      "This tomb reveals the new Roman influence which the Anguiers introduced into France. The model for the monument as a whole is to be sought early in the century in Giacomo della Porta's Aldobrandini tombs in S. Maria sopra Minerva, although Anguier has enriched the design by sculptured decoration. The style of the figure sculpture is a variation of that which the artists would have learnt in the studio of Algardi in the 1640s, that is to say, a form of Baroque less extreme than Bernini's, and therefore more easily acceptable than his to a French public. The reclining figure of the Duke shows clearly the combination of influences present here. The pose is one traditional in France since the early seventeenth century, but the twist on the body, the undercut curls of the hair, and the lively treatment of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry all betray a Roman origin. In the figure of the Duchess classical influence is more visible, and this is even more clearly the case with the allegorical statues at the side of the main group which were executed by pupils.

The very position of the figure, the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry on the right, which adumbrates a corresponding one on the left, with, in the centre, a Madonna against the background of a typical Veneto scenery, would appear to suggest a work of Venetian inspiration, such as can be seen in Tosio Martinengo of Brescia's altarpiece of St Anthony of Padua. His richly \"atmospheric\" Venetian colour scheme in particular bears witness to yet another attempt of his to test the tonal gamut. This is the particular moment in time that marks the birth of Moretto's true art at the confluence of Venetian painting and Brescian milieu, stamped by Moroni's, Romanino's and Savoldo's work, and seminal to an alternating pattern of fabulous colouring shot through with the cachets of the radical tradition of Lombardy.\n",

      "Jan Davidsz de Heem, who was to win an international reputation as one of the greatest European still-life painters, also spent time in Leiden. The most interesting works he painted during his stay there from the mid-twenties to the early thirties are vanitas still-lifes, mainly comprising piles of old, well-used books that signal the vanity of the scholarly life.In about 1635 he moved to Antwerp and in 1637 became a citizen of the city. Apart from some trips to Utrecht, his native city, he remained active in Antwerp for two decades and then is registered there as a non-resident citizen. His long stay in Antwerp earns him a place in the history of Flemish as well as Dutch art. By the late 1660s de Heem settled in Utrecht where he lived until 1672, the disastrous year that Louis XIV's armies invaded the Netherlands. Then he returned to Antwerp where he was active until his death. According to Sandrart (1675) he left Utrecht for Antwerp because 'there one could have rare fruit of all kinds, large plums, peaches, cherries, oranges, lemons, g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s, and others in finer condition and state of ripeness to draw from life ...' The reason Sandrart offers for his move can be questioned. Is it not possible that de Heem fled to Antwerp to avoid living under the invading French troops?It was during his first years in Antwerp that de Heem found his special province. There he painted his famous flower pieces which occasionally have overt moralizing messages. In Antwerp he made contact with the Flemish Jesuit Daniel Seghers (1590-1661), who, after Jan Brueghel, was the most accomplished south Netherlandish flower painter of the century. Seghers depicted bouquets but his speciality was painting garlands encircling a cartouche with a religious scene, a sculptural image, or a portrait, frequently painted by another artist. De Heem adapted Seghers's cartouche motif and painted hanging garlands as well. The individual blooms in these works are as colourful and as accurately portrayed as Bosschaert's, but they are done with a freer brush, introduce chiaroscuro effects, and have asymmetrical arrangements. The host of de Heem's followers and later flower painters use similar pictorial devices.In Antwerp de Heem also began to paint his celebrated abundant displays on carpet-covered tables piled high with ornate silver platters and baskets of huge, expensive fruit, and glistening lobsters. These works are usually embellished with exquisite trappings, precious metal vessels, and delicate glassware. An outstanding very large, early one at the Louvre (this picture) was in the collection of Louis XIV before 1683. The Dutch call lavish still-lifes of this type 'pronk stilleven' (pronk means sumptuous or ostentatious). The term is traditionally used to categorize overt displays of magnificent banquets and luxury items painted from the mid- to the late decades of the century. De Heem, Willem Kalf, and Abraham van Beyeren were the leading practitioners of the type. Their patrons presumably belonged to the upper echelons of society and made no secret of their expensive tastes.De Heem is one of the rare Dutch artists who captured some of the exuberance of Flemish Baroque painting, and soon after he settled in Antwerp in the 1630s his colouristic splendour rivals that of the native Flemings. The success of his flower pieces and pronk still-lifes won him many pupils and imitators both in Flanders and in the northern Netherlands, and occasionally it is difficult to separate his handfrom works done by his followers. His son Cornelis de Heem (1631-95) can come dangerously close to his father.De Heem's works were also frequently copied during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As late as 1893 Matisse made a close reduced copy (Nice-Cimioz, MusÃ©e Matisse) after the large composition in the Louvre. He sold the copy, then bought it back and used it as an inspiration for his Variation on a Still Life by de Heem (1915; New York, Museum of Modern Art) which is about the size of the huge original. Though Matisse's Variation on de Heem still shows an unmistakable debt to the Dutch painter's composition, it has been completely translated into his personal style of these years.\n"

      "The story of the Holy Family's flight was one of the most popular apocryphal legends which survived the prohibitive decrees of the Council of Trent and often appeared in painting from the end of the sixteenth century. Caravaggio's idyllic painting is an individualistic representation of this.The artist ingeniously uses the figure of an angel playing the violin with his back to the viewer to divide the composition into two parts. On the right, before an autumnal river-front scene, we can see the sleeping Mary with a dozing infant in her left; on the left, a seated Joseph holding the musical score for the angel. The natural surroundings reminds the viewer of the Giorgionesque landscapes of the Cinquecento masters of Northern Italian painting, and it is fully imbued with a degree of nostalgia. Contrasting the unlikelihood of the event is the realistic effect of depiction, the accuracy of details, the trees, the leaves and stones, whereby the total impression becomes astonishingly authentic. The statue-like figure of the angel, with a white robe d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d around him, is like a charmingly shaped musical motif, and it provides the basic tone for the composition.

His patrician dwelling, one of Brussels' most sumptuous residences, lay opposite the church of Our Lady of the Sablon, for which he commissioned impressive works to embellish the octagonal Chapel of St Ursula. The entrance porch and the funerary monument that Lamoral ordered in 1676 from Mattheus van Beveren were both created at around the same time. The tomb, signed on the plinth, is dated 1678. From this spectacular white marble monument - undoubtedly one of the most attractive examples of European funerary architecture - the Brussels Museum possesses the virtuously modelled and finely detailed terracotta model.This is the first example in the Low Countries of a funerary monument depicting an allegorical scene. It is not the deceased that is depicted here, but on the left Virtue and on the right, Time. The composition is theatrical: two pilasters and a rounded arch enclose the black marble niche in which the symbolic group stands. Virtus, a stately and attractively d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d female figure who could have come from antiquity, holds in her two hands a chain to which is attached an armorial cartouche. To the right stands Tempus or Chronos, with his scythe, standing firm and at the same time trying to pull the shield towards himself. The central figure with the raised Theban trumpet is seen by various authors as being Fame or Fama. However, the text on the tomb in the funerary chapel tells us that this is the angel of the Last Judgment. The group should therefore be interpreted as follows: the person who lives virtuously is not worn down by time; through the voice of the angel of the last day and God's trumpet, the deceased is asking that his relations and everyone who visits his tomb wish him a blessed eternal life. The stately attitude of Virtue matches her determination, whilst the cramped pose of Time reflects the hopelessness of his enterprise and the angel's exuberant movement symbolises the flight into eternity.Van Beveren drew his inspiration for this composition from an engraving by Nicolaas van der Horst, a pupil of Rubens, composed as the title print for the book Marques d'honneur de la maison de Tassis (1645).\n",

      "The Valier funeral monument was erected for the Doge Bertuccio Valier (1656-58), his wife Elisabetta Querini Valier (d. 1709), and their son Doge Silvestro Valier (1694-1700). Architect Andrea Tirali was aided in the decoration by a number of artists, three of whom can be clearly identified since they signed their work: Giovanni Bonazza, Antonio Tarsia, and Pietro Baratta, three of the best-known sculptors of their day.The Valier monument was ambitious. Its debt to Longhena's <a href=\"/html/l/longhena/1/pesaro.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/l/longhena/1/pesaro.html')\">mausoleum for Doge Giovanni Pesaro</a> is combined with references to the <a href=\"/html/p/parodi/2morosin.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/p/parodi/2morosin.html')\">Morosini monument</a> by Filippo Parodi. The drama of the monument comes from the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry which forms the backdrop against which the three figures of the doge's family stand: Bertuccio Valier is in the middle  between his wife and their son.Bonazza's contribution to the monument is the group of Virtue Crowning Merit, placed in the centre of the two arches, and the relief of Time on one of the marble sections of the base. This group, showing clearly the influence of Parodi, is flanked by the pendant statues Liberality by Antonio Tarsia and Wisdom by Pietro Baratta. Both derive from Josse De Corte's earlier models. Similarly, Peace and Charity are signed by Tarsia and Baratta. The work of both artists stands out for its high quality.\n",

      "'And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God . . . And they cried with a loud voice . . . And white robes were given to every one of them . . .' (Revelation of St John, VI, 9-11).The Opening of the Fifth Seal is a large fragment of one of three altarpieces El Greco contracted to paint in 1608 for the church of the Hospital of St John the Baptist (the Tavera Hospital). Located just outside the walls of Toledo, the hospital was founded in 1541 by Cardinal Juan Tavera (1472-1545), who is buried in the church. Of this project for the altarpieces, three pictures survive: an Annunciation (ColecciÃ³n Santander Central Hispano, Madrid, the upper portion showing a choir of angels has been cut and is in the National Gallery, Athens), a Baptism (installed on a side altar in the church), and The Opening of the Fifth Seal (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The painting has been cut at the top, where there was possibly a representation of the Throne: 'And immediately I was in the spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne . . . and round about the throne were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders . . . And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book . . . sealed with seven seals . . .' (Revelation of St John, IV -V).In the foreground is an incredibly elongated, ecstatic figure of St John, his head turned imploringly heavenward, his arms raised. Behind him are two roups of figures. The three on the right, seen against a green d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, are male and reach upwards for white garments distributed by a flying cherub. The four on the left are shown in front of a mustard-coloured cloth. Two are male, two female, and they seem to be covering (or uncovering) themselves with the yellow d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry. The Spirit as 'a living flame, striving upwards', and this strange compatibility of infinite darkness and 'all-consuming light' is met with in the writings of the mystics of his time, Saint Teresa of Jesus and Saint John of the Cross. El Greco realises the apocalyptical vision in colour, light and movement.This project was El Greco's last large-scale undertaking, and he did not live to complete it. The unfinished painting fittingly closes his career.\n",

The Rood Screen, of which the principal panels are preserved in the Louvre, was executed in collaboration with Lescot. Its sculptured decoration consists of a central panel of the Pietà flanked by four smaller reliefs of the evangelists. The Pietà is based on various Italian motives; the pose of the dead Christ is from an engraving of Parmigianino, and other elements come from Rosso, particularly the figure of the fainting Virgin and the close-cropped curls with which almost all the characters are equipped. The most striking feature of the relief is the patterning of closely repeated parallel folds against the plain ground of the panel, a treatment of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry inspired partly by Cellini, whose influence seems to be mainly responsible for Goujon's change in style after his arrival in Paris.\n"

The sculptural qualities of his facial structure have been emphasised in a striking manner. The rippling locks of the wig have not been given the compact fullness typical of many rulers' busts from around 1700, but instead have a linear delicacy. Likewise, the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s of his cloak have been kept relatively flat, so as to emphasise the volumes of the head and focus attention on the face of the king with his lively gaze. Hanging across his cuirass is the sash of the Catholic Polish Order of the White Eagle, which Augustus reintroduced in 1705 as the Order of the House of Wettin, and visible on his cloak above is the order's star. The cloak has been d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d in such a way as to conceal the king's left shoulder; its folds echo the shield-like contour of the bust and allow part of the armour and the beginnings of an arm to show.

Placed on the table are two vases of flowers and a basket of fruit arranged in a triangle and surrounded by single pieces of fruit scattered at random. Two flies can be seen on the brightly lit wall at the upper left, and, in the foreground, some fruit and two bunches of g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s hang over the edge of the table creating a trompe-l'oeil effect. The painting aims for the same heightened sense of reality seen in Caravaggio's Boy with a Basket of Fruit. This Table (a more appropriate title than the conventional Still-life with Flowers and Fruit) shares a number of affinities with the depictions of tables laid for eating painted in Holland throughout the seventeenth century. It may be no coincidence that the first dated painting of this type from 1610 was the work of Floris van Dijck. In 1600-01 Van Dijck lived near the studio of Cavaliere d'Arpino, where pictures like the Hartford still-life were probably executed. It was Van Dijck who supplied the information about Cavaliere d'Arpino for Karel van Mander's biography.The Hartford Table has elicited attributions of enormous diversity. The names of Giovanni Battista Crescenzi, Caravaggio, Francesco Zucchi, Prospero Orsi and finally, for no very convincing reason, the Flemish painter Frans Snyders have all been suggested. Although the attribution to Caravaggio does not seem tenable, the Hartford Table is the work of a painter who, like Caravaggio, may have been active in the studio of Cavaliere d'Arpino. It is possible that the picture can be identified with an unattributed still-life listed in the 1607 inventory of Cavaliere d'Arpino's sequestered possessions. In the first decade of the seventeenth century, this anonymous painter was evidently completely familiar with the work of Caravaggio, but chose to present his own, different interpretation of it. It has also been suggested that this Italian artist, who was influenced by Caravaggism, also possessed some familiarity with the work of the first generation of Flemish still-life painters.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/19_cent/tchaikovsky_nutcracker_waltz.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker, ballet suite, op. 71, Waltz of the Flowers</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

However, the name of one of his grandson's artists was Master HonorÃ© and he worked for the court of Philip the Fair (1285-1314). Little is known about his career. He lived in Paris on the south bank; a small group of manuscripts can be attributed to him. From them it is clear that by his time the style of Louis IX's painters had been significantly altered.Master HonorÃ©'s illumination is still extremely graceful and elegant, but architectural motifs play a far smaller part in the decoration. Faces and hands are extremely pallid and almost completely without colour, even more emphasis being laid on the drawing. By contrast, the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry is fuller and the folds heavier.

      "George Goring Junior (c. 1555-1602) of Ovingdean and Danny Park, Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, MP for Lewes in 1593 and 1601, was the eldest son of George Goring (c. 1522-1594), also an MP for Lewes (elected to the English parliament in 1563).In this portrait, the courtly aspirations of George Goring are vibrantly captured by Gower in the sitter's resplendent costume; his fine lace cartwheel ruff and black velvet cloak embroidered in silver and gold thread with g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> vines and acorns are worthy of the Elizabethan courtier he aspired to be. Golden acorns further adorn his doublet and the buttons themselves are acorn-shaped, all symbolising his pedigree as a 'great oak'.

      "In 1513 Bellini signed and dated the altarpiece with Saints Christopher, Jerome and Louis of Toulouse of the church of San Giovanni Crisostomo in Venice. (It is usually referred to as the Altarpiece of San Giovanni Crisostomo.)The painting had been commissioned in 1494 by the merchant Giorgio Diletti, who had left instructions in his will for the construction of an altar and the execution of an altarpiece to go with it representing Saints Jerome, Louis and Crisostomo. The almost twenty years that elapsed between the ordering and execution of the altarpiece, and the partial modification of the identity of the saints requested by Diletti, have raised a number of queries which scholars have only partly resolved. The first uncertainty concerns the bishop saint on the right holding a book bearing the inscription \"De civitate Dei\", which has led some scholars to identify him with St Augustine. However, the inscription on the book is almost certainly a later addition: its extraneousness is revealed by the fact that it is written on the back of the volume and by the uncertainty of the inscription itself, unimaginable in Bellini who was always highly accurate and extremely precise. Besides, the Anjou lilies on the bishop's cloak confirm that it must be the French noble Louis, who renounced the throne to become a Franciscan. According to a complex iconological interpretation of the altarpiece, St Louis in his lavish bishop's robes represents a pastoral and liturgical significance. In this he provides a contrast with Christopher, an emblem of the active faith and preaching, and both are placed under an arch, a symbolic image of the church, on which the second verse of Psalm 14 is written in Greek: \"The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God\". The choice of the Greek language is explained, besides the fact that the church of San Giovanni Crisostomo was the centre of the Greco-Venetian community, also by remembering Bellini's contacts with the erudite circle that revolved around Aldo Manuzio. Manuzio, indeed, is credited with an important edition in Greek of the Psalter, which was printed between 1496 and 1498.Beyond the pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>t St Jerome, a hermit and doctor of the Church, represents the highest point of spiritual life, that of mystical exaltation and revealed science. Beside him the fig-tree symbolizes that he has been chosen by the Lord to understand its supreme law.According to this interpretation we are therefore confronted by a clear, conscious stand-point in the contemporary religious debate that existed in Venice during those years: a position by which action and contemplation are a unitary moment in the ecclesiastical path.Undoubtedly such a complex and culturally significant proposition must have been established by the client in the first place; nonetheless, Bellini's humanistic and theological lucidity too is certainly confirmed once again.\n",

      "The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle. In the centre of the ceiling is the much-admired oculus, opening onto a painted sky. The interplay of levels of reality elaborates ideas already set forth in his art. Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled. In the triangular spaces at the edges of the ceiling are twelve mythological scenes of Orpheus, Orion, and Hercules with backgrounds of simulated mosaics, a device that Raphael was to use in the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura. Only two of the walls have figurative narrations: the north wall with a scene that is usually called the Court and the west wall, divided into three scenes, Servants with Horse and Dogs, the Inscription with Putti, and the Meeting. The remaining two walls are painted with imitation leather d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries that encroach upon the other sides as well to create the fiction that there were curtains before all four walls and on two sides they had been opened up to reveal the events depicted.The central subject of the frescoes is Ludovico III Gonzaga, his wife, his children, and his court. A closed letter held by Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga in the Meeting seems to be the same one, now opened, that Ludovico, seated majestically, holds in the Court, and must be considered important for understanding the paintings. The style of the frescoes is similar to Mantegna's previous works. The compositions are dominated by the narrative elements, with the figures set frieze-like, close to the picture plane within a narrow spatial shelf in front of a landscape or architectural setting.\n"

      "Painted for the central panel of the High Altarpiece of the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, Toledo, the commission which brought him to Spain. This, the first work executed in Spain, is the only painting by El Greco bearing the date of its execution. It is the first large-scale painting by his hand.There is a clear reminiscence of Venetian paintings of the subject, and specifically of <a href=\"/html/t/tiziano/01a/1assunt1.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/t/tiziano/01a/1assunt1.html')\">Titian's early masterpiece</a> in the church of the Frari in Venice, but the treatment is his own. The Virgin rises as from a chalice formed by the two unified groups on either side of the open tomb, which introduce and extend motifs developed in his Cleansing of the Temple and Healing of the Blind. A complete unity is achieved in this bipartite composition, in which the circle of Apostles, with its contained and concentrated internal movement, or emotion, is continued in the circle of angels with their easy and sympathetic movement around the rising figure of the Virgin. There is a sustained rhythm of the expressions, gestures and surface treatment within each group, and an easy and inevitable connection of one group with another. This is achieved essentially by paint, the measured relationship of the passages of colour over the surface. This also explains his treatment of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries, which has its own logic, has no suggestion of conflict, but is also not concerned with disclosing the anatomy beneath.When we compare the The Assumption of the Virgin with the famous painting on the same subject by <a href=\"/html/t/tiziano/01a/1assunt1.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/t/tiziano/01a/1assunt1.html')\">Titian in the Frari Church</a> in Venice, it becomes clear how new were the paths El Greco took in Spain. Under the influence of Michelangelo he not only found an unusually naturalistic style with monumental figures, but adopted a palette tending towards that of the Roman school. The great luminosity of the painting is striking, an illumination that, probably not coincidentally, conforms with the real light falling on it from above.No other version of the subject is known, but the painting may be regarded as the forerunner of the related composition of the <a href=\"/html/g/greco_el/07/0706grec.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/g/greco_el/07/0706grec.html')\">Immaculate Conception,</a> a subject more compatible with El Greco's mystical approach to the Universe.\n",

      "Even today a 'Jan Steen household' is what the Dutch call a boisterous and ramshackle family. Jan Steen painted many such families, often including his own portrait as a pipe-smoking, beer-drinking, cheerful rake. His prolific output, during a career when he was constantly on the move from town to town, and the very high quality of much of his work, should make us beware of a literal interpretation of this raffish portrayal of the artist. One of the many Dutch seventeenth-century painters who remained Catholics, Steen is a moralist, but he relies on popular proverbs, the popular theatre and festive customs to preach through laughter at the human comedy: people like ourselves behaving as they shouldn't.Not all his paintings are of this kind. E.g. the landscapelike Skittle Players outside an Inn, which despite its subject seems to make no disparaging comment on the people taking their ease in the summer sunshine, or a late Two Men and a Young Woman making Music on a Terrace, which anticipates the eighteenth-century painter Watteau's lyrical and melancholy compositions. Steen also painted biblical and mythological subjects and portraits. While many of his pictures are small; the Effects of Intemperance is on a larger scale and demonstrates the broader touch he may have learned from Hals during his nine-year stay in Haarlem.The woman on the left is that most reprehensible creature, a Dutch housewife and mother who is not teaching her children virtue. She has slumped in drunken slumber, her clay pipe slipping from her hand. The little coal brazier by her side threatens to set fire to her gown, and her child is picking her pocket. Above her head hangs a basket in which the fate of those who grow up without parental guidance is foretold: it contains the crutch and clapper of the beggar and the birch of judicial punishment. Another child illustrates a Dutch proverb by throwing roses (we would say 'pearls') before swine, while the trio to the right waste a good meat pie by feeding it to a cat. The parrot, that mimic of human behaviour, is drinking wine given to him by the maid, as luxuriously dressed as her mistress and almost as tipsy, while in the arbour beyond a man, perhaps the father, is dallying with a buxom girl - 'wine is a mocker' indeed, as the saying goes.Just as the ancient painter Zeuxis painted g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s so realistically that birds came to peck at them, so may we, attracted by Steen's ravishing still life in the foreground, the glow of pewter and the shimmer of silks, be drawn to taste his wares. Through looking deep into his picture, we may yet reform our ways and so avoid the effects of intemperance.\n"

The church was designed in 1488 by Giovanni Battagio, continued by Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono and finished by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. It was built at expenses of the Lodi commune, whence the denomination \"Civico\" (\"Municipal\"), on the site previously occupied by a brothel.A centralized, octagonal plan and prolific ornament characterize Battaggio's design for the church.

Although he was primarily interested in painting religious subjects for ecclesiastical commissions, he also produced some outstandings portraits, often inserting them into his religious compositions, as for example in the famous \"Burial of Count Orgaz\" in Toledo. His formal portraits and studies from life are characterized by an element of drama and a penetrating insight into the character of the sitter. He was not interested in depicting the background, nor in the insignia of rank or office which would indicate the subject's worldly status or occupation, and his sitters nearly always face the spectator and their faces reveal the soul within.No doubt the Study of a Man is a likeness, though we do not know the identity of the model nor in what connection it came to be produced.

      "David owed his rise to fame - after many reversals - to a painting for the execution of which he took his family to Rome, in order to absorb himself totally in the world of antique forms. It was The Oath of the Horatii.When he arrived to Rome, David rent a studio in the Via del Babuino. He worked in a very methodical manner on The Oath of the Horatii, drawing from life models and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d mannequins, and some very detailed studies survive for many of the main figures. He had accessories such as the swords and helmets made by local craftsmen so that they could serve as props. Drouais is supposed to have assisted David, painting the arm of the rear Horatii brother and the yellow garment of Sabina. The painting was finished at the end of July 1785, and was then exhibited in David's studio. David signed the painting and added the painting's place of origin to the signature and date: L David / faciebat / Romanae /Anno MDCCLXXXIV. The painting created a sensation, even the Pope wanted to view it.The story is from the 7th century B.C., and it tells of the triplet sons of Publius Horatius, who decided the struggle between Rome and Albalonga. One survived, but he killed his own sister because she wept for one of the fallen foes, to whom she was betrothed. Condemned to death for the murder of a sibling, Horatius' son is pardoned by the will of the people.Because of its austerity and depiction of dutiful patriotism, The Oath of the Horatii is often considered to be the clearest expression of Neoclassicism in painting. The painting's uncompromising directness, economy and tension made it instantly memorable and full of visual impact. Each of the three elements of the picture - the sons, the father and the women - is framed by a section of a Doric arcade, and the figures are located in a narrow stage-like space. David split the picture between the masculine resolve of the father and brothers and the slumped resignation of the women.. The focal point of the work is occupied by the swords that old Horatius is about to distribute to his sons. While the rear two brothers take the oath with their left hands, the foremost one swears with his right. Perhaps David did this simply as a way of grouping the figures together, but people at the time noticed this detail, and some supposed that this meant that the brother in the front would be the one to survive the combat.\n",

      "Giambattista Tiepolo very early withdrew from the lessons he was receiving from Gregorio Lazzarini, an academic of mediocre talents, and developed rather towards the vigorous chiaroscuro of Federico Bencovich and Piazzetta, renderÃ­ng their solutions still more refined and precious by using colours which have an absolutely unmistakable, densely fused luminous vibration to them. At the end of this fundamental experience come the canvas of The <font color=\"ff0000\">Rape</font> of Europa in which the mythological subject is depicted in an airy, disenchanted transcription which at times becomes almost caricature. The severity of the pattern of chiaroscuro loses intensity in favour of refinement of chromatic notes in an interpretation of space open and articulated in depth which is as far from Bencovich and Piazzetta as it is consonant with the taste of Sebastiano Ricci. And the very lively spacial and luministic framework in which the figures take their places with such easy confidence offers a foretaste of the supreme gifts of Tiepolo as an 'organizer' of paintings.\n",

In 1549 he collaborated with Jean Cousin the Elder in organizing the ceremonial entry of Henry II into Paris, an event that allowed the new generation of classicizing artists to display their skills. Goujon's most famous work, the Fountain of the Innocents, the architecture of which was probably by Lescot, was originally built as a monument for this occasion. It was, until 1787, a rectangular structure on a corner, presenting two arched bays to the Rue aux Fers and one to the Rue Saint-Denis. The bays were articulated by fluted composite pilasters, between which were narrow vertical relief panels of nymphs holding urns. Horizontal relief panels of tritons and nymphs were placed above and below each bay, and the spandrels of the arches were filled by winged personifications of Fame.The present appearance of the monument, as a free-standing, four-sided structure, is the result of a late 18th-century rebuilding for which Augustin Pajou provided extra sculpture in an able pastiche of Goujon's style. The vertical relief panels remain in situ, but the horizontal ones were removed around 1810 (now MusÃ©e du Louvre, Paris).

The landscape is also far removed from Sienese tradition, dotted about with Roman reminiscences and flanked by a fantastical crag such as we might find later in the work of Piero di Cosimo.

It is a mix of Florentine and Neapolitan elements, an exported style conforming to local traditions. The classical, fluted columns, paired pilasters, classicising caryatid figures carrying the tomb chest, and the schiacciato relief decorating the chest are characteristic Florentine art, but the shape of the tomb with its baldachin-like architectural frame and the angels standing behind the figure of the dead cardinal and pulling apart the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries as if to reveal it are typical of Neapolitan tombs.The work was presumably started in Rainaldo Brancacci's lifetime who died on 5 June 1427.

Only the relief of the Assumption of the Virgin can definitely attributed to Donatello.\n"

      "The allegorical figure of the Good Shepherd was originally based on the pagan representation of a man bringing his offering to the altar but, by the 3rd century, had also come to represent the 'ram bearer' with its connotations of philanthropy and loving care. The latter image accorded well with the Christians’ understanding of a divine Shepherd who would lay down his life for his flock. In a period of persecution, such images had the advantage of directly addressing the adherents of the Christian faith while not drawing attention to them, since the images were already popular with non-Christians.There are some 26 extant marbles from antiquity depicting Jesus as the Good Shepherd. The figure is usually beardless and youthful and carries a sheep d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d over the shoulders.

One is the Holy Cross altar, about which the 1782 contract drawn up with the painter, IstvÃ¡n Dorffmaister and the sculptor, Ferenc MÃ¼ller has remained to us. The other is the Pietà altar decorated by the picture exhibited here. Very early in the year 1783 a cabinet-maker was paid for having dissembled and reassembled the high altar and the two sidealtars in 1782. One of the (old) side-altars may have been the Pietà one whose altarpiece was perhaps made at the same time with the high altar's painting (cat. no 108Ã–, as its technique of execution suggests. We consider both that altarpiece and this side-altarpiece as works made in the 1750's by Joseph Ignaz Mildorfer.18th century Pietà compositions usually feature few figures: in most of them, there is but an angel to share the grief of Mary shown broken over her dead son. However, the Sopron altarpiece was composed by its painter from five figures, arranging St. John supporting Mary, Mary Magdalene wiping Christ's wounds and a woman embracing his hanging arm around the central figure of Christ himself lying in her mother's lap. The picture's basic tone is grim and dark. Its figures are almost bodyless. Glaring lights illuminate the faces depicted in sharp foreshortening and some widely fluttering d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries that make the composition almost burst. The figures of the windblown vision are mostly linked by the strange expressive forms of the strongly accentuated hands in a feature characteristic of Mildorfer's art in the style of the 1750s. His painting at Sopron is not related to his early Pietà (St. Moritzen bei Telfs, 1742) but rather to the sketch at Graz, similarly unquiet in the intensity of expression (Graz, Joanneum). Here again, similarly to many other works of his. Mildorfer set out from a composition by Troger: his figure of Christ is almost a paraphrase of Troger's Pietà in Vienna (Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien), yet without the latter's power of plasticity and confidence of composition.\n",

There is a sign of uncertainty in the awkward way that the boy's long thick neck rises out of his shoulder blades, yet there is compensation in the poetic device which places his weary eyes partially in the shade.Once again Caravaggio has used the diagonal 'cellar' light which was to become a hallmark of his style.

(They even produced for export, e.g. statues were ordered from Rome for the Palace-Monastery of Mafra near Lisbon.) Sculpture was now firmly fixed in the style of Bernini. Camillo Rusconi, the Frenchman Pierre Legros (1666-1719) and RenÃ©-Michel (called Michel-Ange) Slodtz are among the sculptors most typical of this continuation of the Baroque.The tomb of Pope Gregory XIII in St Peter's is one of Rusconi's masterpieces.

Religion looks up to the figure of the Pope giving benediction as Fortitude lifts the massive d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry to reveal a sarcophagus with a relief commemorating the Gregorian emendation of the calendar.

Sarazin's caryatids may claim to be the first works of French classicism in sculpture, and are thus the exact parallel to the work of Poussin and FranÃ§ois Mansart at the same moment in the other two arts. From the frontal poses, the archaeological accuracy of the dress, and the treatment of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries we can see that Sarazin has not taken his classicism entirely second-hand through the artists he had known in Italy but has also looked directly at ancient Roman statues.The sculpture was executed by Sarazin's workshop (Gilles GuÃ©rin, Philippe de Buyster and Thibaut Poissant) after the terracotta model by Sarazin, and under the direction by Sarazin.

A third, bowl-shaped glass stands - scarcely visible - between the fluted glass and the lobster. A small collection of flowers - roses, a carnation, violets - forms a colourful point of light and a visual counterweight to the dominating red lobster to the left of the bowl.

Despite the undoubted quality of the piece, sealed with the master's name on the top left corner, a detailed stylistic investigation and a closer analysis of the signature by De Heem expert Fred G. Meijer have cast justified doubt on the true author. Recently a canvas from the Joseph Verner Reed collection was designated by him as the prototype for this and other, already known variants. Who painted this version remains for the time being an intriguing question: we do not immediately know any figure in De Heem's immediate and wider circle to whom to attribute this painting exploit.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/19_cent/rimsky-korsakov_bumble_bee.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov: The Flight of the Bumble Bee</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

His particular appeal in the eyes of an English public lay in the fact that he did not use the historical situation to magnify the dignity of the sitter to the point of heroism, and did not stylise the figure of the colonel into a monumental bearer of history.Colonel Johnson is shown in a relaxed pose, with an Indian cloak d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d over his uniform and moccasins on his feet. Behind him, in the half shadow, stands an Indian chief who is smiling down on the seated man and pointing out, with a gesture of his left hand, the peaceful existence of his tribe, visible in the background.

After his arrival to Rome, friendship with the Bolognese painter Domenichino led to his first independent commission, the stucco figures of St John the Evangelist and St Mary Magdalene. These reveal a remarkably self-assured artistic personality, one that did not alter significantly over the course of his career. Bolognese training is evident in both works, which are reminiscent of Domenichino in d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry style and of Ludovico Carracci in sweetness of expression.

      "The Virgin is a key focal point in the pictorial imagery. Of all the figures, she is the most illuminated, lit by a strong raking light from the left. She is clearly visible, isolated in the open space of the upper dais. Her rose and light blue garments stand out beside the darker red lake and ultramarine of the robes of God the Father. But in spite of this spotlit place at centre stage, the dramatic presence of the Virgin is intentionally undercut by having her turn away from the viewer toward God the Father and by concealing the lines of her body beneath swathes of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry. Her profile is barely visible.This rendering of the Virgin was consistent with the image upheld before the Benedictine nuns for whom the altarpiece was executed at the high altar of the church of Sant'Ambrogio.

The collaboration of two or more artists, specialists in different subject categories, were common in seventeenth-century Flanders. In Holland, such collaborations were less frequent, although it did occur. In Dutch still-life the joining forces of Pieter Claesz. and his fellow-townsman in Haarlem, Roelof Koets  is an example that stands out.The two painters were friends, living in Haarlem. They testified several times together as witnesses in lawsuits. They produced ten collaborative paintings, dating between 1644 and 1653. In these paintings Koets's hand can easily be distinguished: his sidelong lighting is more dramatic and more playful than that of Pieter Claesz., his foliage comes out stronger against a darker background, his oblong g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s are build up out of thin transparent layers.\n",

All Poussin's severity and pessimism seem to have disappeared in these paintings, to be replaced by a fusion of all the poetical leanings in his nature. They are the supreme expression, not in this case of mind over eye, but of praise for the beauty and grandeur of nature, now ordered by man, and now defeating man. Spring is luxuriant, Summer a fecund harvest, Autumn the gathering of mellow g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s and Winter the terrible deluge in which all mankind is overwhelmed and destroyed.These pictures exist on a complex series of levels, and even the most unscholarly spectator must be aware that Poussin was trying to balance moods and ideas in a much more subtle and intricate way than usual. Firstly, the pictures are a sequence, and they are hung in this way in the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. Spring is cool in tone, Summer and Autumn are warm, and Winter is cold. Even this obvious modulation of tones has its own rhythm. In all but Winter man is seen in harmony with nature, especially in Spring, surely one of the most perfect evocations of Paradise since the subject was attempted by fifteenth-century Netherlandish painters.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/18_cent/vivaldi_rv297_winter.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Vivaldi: Concerto in F minor RV 297 op. 8 No. 4 (Winter)</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

It is interesting to note that quite unusually the figure in the centre is Judas and not Christ.The stylistic vocabulary of Riemenschneider is easy to characterize. His feminine figures, with some minor variants, all have a slender stature - narrow bust, frail limbs, fine hands - hair set in peaceful waves, a sweet face with smooth modelling and a broad flat forehead, eyes slanted towards the temples and circled by a fold of skin, a long nose and small mouth with a slight swelling of the lower lip. The masculine faces, built on the same plan, with, of course, thicker and more rugged features, present some distinct types found in many combinations in Riemenschneider's various works, as witnessed by the apostles of Rothenburg and Creglingen. The play of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries, animated by uneven folds broken into multiple facets, is complicated but without excessive agitation.

His approval, however, would have been anachronistic if he did not correlate it with the artist's effort to create a plausible illusion of space on the two-dimensional surface of the canvas.

      "The Crevole Madonna and the Madonna of Buonconvento are unanimously considered the earliest works attributable to Duccio. The basic approach of the two paintings is of evident Byzantine tradition: the elegant stylization of the hands, the typical downward curving nose, the red maphÃ³rion under Mary's veil, the dark d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry animated by shining gilded lines. New details appear, to a lesser extent in the Buonconvento Madonna and repeated with greater confidence in the Crevole painting, such as the subtle play of light on the Virgin's face, over her chin and cheeks, and a clear attempt at plasticism in the folds of the garment around the face.The more carefully considered compositon of the Crevole Madonna shows a faint but decided French influence: the elegant forms of the angels in the upper corners, the veiled transparency of the Child's garment, held up by a curious knotted cord, and most of all, the intimate gesture of the Infant Jesus, held in a tender embrace.\n",

In the background is a distant hilly landscape with green trees on the left and a leafless tree on the right, enlivened by the deep blue hues of the sky. Fruits and flowers in this composition enclose Christian symbolic meanings alluding to the life of Christ and are not therefore mere decorative devices.

The statues, the completion of Borromini's project, were executed before 1718 by the most important sculptors of the time from Rome and elsewhere. The sculptors included Camillo Rusconi (Andrew, Matthew, James the Greater, John the Evangelist), Francesco Moratti (Simon), Angelo de' Rossi (James the Less), Giuseppe Mazzuoli (Philip), Lorenzo Ottoni (Thaddeus), as well as the Frenchmen Pierre-Ã‰tienne Monnot (Peter, Paul) and Pierre Le Gros (Bartholomew, Thomas).It was a sign of Monnot's eminence that he should be chosen for participation in the sculptural project aiming to complete the decoration of the Lateran basilica. Monnot was commissioned with the statues of St Peter and St Paul.Monnot's St Peter is one of the finest of the Apostle series, with the prince of the apostles presented as a Classical orator with a decisive gesture of the right hand and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry that rigidly conforms to the lines of the body.\n",

Both figures are unquestionably Baroque, but, in contrast to the dynamic composition of the Bernini, Duquesnoy' figure is absolutely static and posed; even the slightly over-elaborate d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries are motionless.\n"

      "This tale from the life of St Peter is recorded in the collection of legends written down by Jacobus a Voragine in the 13th century. It tells how the apostle, having triumphed over Simon Magus, was persuaded by the Christians of Rome to leave town. Jacobus a Voragine relates how Peter encountered Christ on the Appian way and asked \"Quo vadis domine\" (Whither goest thou, master?), to which Christ replied \"To Rome, to be crucified anew.\"This apocryphal legend is in fact the beginning of Peter's own martyrdom. This would certainly explain the vigorous movements in Carracci's painting, with the apostle recoiling in terror. It is not the unexpected encounter with the risen Christ that has taken the apostle aback, but his awareness of his own human frailty. Annibale's magnificent rhetoric reminds the spectator of Christ's call to turn back.The viewer is on the Appian Way with Peter, or rather, is Peter meeting Christ. The foot of the cross protrudes from the panel, Christ's hand points outwards, and the shadows he casts attest to his corporeality as he strides toward us. While Peter's left foot remained in place, the rest of the figure was altered during painting, drawn back to the right edge of the panel in an attitude half-way between terror and obeisance, more deeply felt than his earlier pose but also making room for our implied presence. Firm contours delimit Christ's athletic bo,dy, yet its internal modelling is subtly lifelike, rippling with the movement of muscles and the angle at which surfaces catch the light. It is obvious that this figure was based on a live model, for his hands and lower legs are more sunburnt than his torso and thighs, although the face he turns to Peter is an idealised mask of pathos under the crown of thorns. Despite the dual sources of light from the background and in the foreground, the same sun seems to warm sky, trees, fields and Roman temples, and the crimson, white, gold and blue d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries, the metal keys, the youthful and the aged flesh and the chestnut and grizzled hair of the two wayfarers at the crossroads between time and eternity.\n",
      "https://www.wga.hu/art/g/giorgion/various/venus.jpg\n",
      "Giorgione exploited the new style evolved in Venice through sensual subject matter. The Sleeping Venus is a case in point. The reclining figure was originally accompanied by a small figure of Cupid, but this figure was painted over in 1843.Giorgione placed the Venus across the whole width of the painting. She stretches one arm behind her head, making a long, continuous slope of body whose gentle curves echo the hills of the landscape behind and suggest some form of connection between the female depicted and nature. Painted at just the moment when Venice was defending its claims on the terra firma, it may, therefore, be possible to read Venus (Venere) as Venice (Venezia).Venus's sensuality is heightened by her red lips and by the deep red velvet and white satin d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry upon which her creamy body lies. Significantly, she is asleep, so the issue of decorum is bypassed. Her sleep implies dreaming and transport of the figure to another world. Thus the painting may be interpreted as a poetic evocation of a classical idyll.Several works of great beauty associated with Giorgione involve the collaboration of another distinctive master. In the Sleeping Venus a significant share has been assumed for Titian, especially in the landscape, where on the right a cupid has been painted out. The outstretched figure, stocky in proportions, is usually considered to be by Giorgione. The drawing is only approximative, with the outlines blurred to produce a gradual transition between the barely modeled flesh and the surrounding surface. But the edges are nonetheless legible, and they form a flattened lozenge-shaped, pale, collage-like form lying close to the picture plane, a device favoured over juxtapositions of darks and lights to conjure up an illusion of three-dimensionality. Giorgione fully exploited the sensuous potential of both the medium and the subject. There is a decidedly erotic air to the totally unselfconscious young woman whose pale flesh is contrasted to the silky cloth.If compared with <a href=\"/html/t/tiziano/08/08urbin.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/t/tiziano/08/08urbin.html')\">Titian's Venus of Urbino</a> the differences between the two become clear since Titian has taken over the pose and the figural type almost verbatim from Giorgione; they are differences of temperament and personality more than of time passed. If the Sleeping Venus was actually completed by Titian, as is frequently assumed, the overall effect remains tightly connected with Giorgione's style, and one might also suppose that it falls chronologically near the end of his short career, for we should assume that it was left unfinished at his death.\n",

This was an inflammatory subject in 1789, speaking out for self-sacrifice, the sacrifice of one's own flesh and blood for a higher ideal.Lucius Junius Brutus (not to be confused with Julius Caesar's assassin Marcus Brutus, who lived some 500 years later), had helped to rid Rome of the last of its kings, the tyrannical Tarquin the Proud.

As the picture title tells us, Brutus' two sons, Titus and Tiberius, were drawn into a royalist conspiracy to return Tarquin, and their father condemned them to death.For the grim and terrible event depicted in the painting, David adopted a radical compositional format. The main character, Brutus, is placed at the extreme left, plunged into deep shadow. His body is tense and knotted as he broods over the consequences of his act, he grasps the death warrant and clenches his feet one across the other. This last detail, in addition to the position of his arms, was probably taken from the figure of the prophet Isaiah on the Sistine Chapel Ceiling by Michelangelo. For the sake of accuracy David based the features of Brutus on a famous antique bust, the so-called Capitoline Brutus, of which he owned a copy. On the other side of the image the inconsolable women are brightly illuminated. The centre of the picture is taken up by a still-life of a sewing basket, an emblem of domesticity, which is rendered in stark clarity.David skillfully illuminated the grief and allegorised the suffering, fear and pain of his figures. He shows the mother, accusing and suffering, her daughter beside her, hands raised defensively, and finally the younger daughter sunk down in pain at her impotence. Another figure at the right edge of the painting personifies grief. In the shadow sits the \"hero\" with the dark mien of a thinker. His features are stoic and harsh, his left hand is holding the written accusation in a claw-like grip, and he is seated in the shadow of the Roma, the symbol of the state to which the sacrifice is ultimately being made. Behind him, the son whose life has fallen victim to the requirements of the state is being borne in. A column strictly divides the theatrical arrangement into the representation of the dark force of destiny and the obvious emotional effect of the event.\n",

      "The picture shows the original wood model for the dome of St Peter's (left) and a section of it (right).In his eighty-fifth year or thereabouts, Michelangelo ordered a large wooden model of the dome. It has been preserved, and proves that his successors kept more or less closely to the original. Deviations are confined mainly to three particulars: instead of confining themselves to the proposed self-contained triangular window cornices, they alternate them with segment cornices. Between the ribs of the vaulting run three concentric and ascending groins to each section, breaking and enlivening the bare, vaulted surfaces. The handsome consoles of the attic above the tambour have been omitted.When one looks at the building the feeling persists that something is missing here, for the bare right angles are abrupt and unmotivated. Why were the consoles left out? Probably because of the prevalent aversion to the Gothic style; any suggestion of the buttress was to be avoided, although in this particular instance it was needed and is in fact present, though camouflaged by Neoclassical pillars in pairs. Here more than in any of his other works the medievalist tastes of the aged Michelangelo, still so fertile of mind, shine through the 'd<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries' of antiquity. Saint Peter's is a medieval dream; in its every rhythm it aspires to heaven and glorifies God. The cupola is the apotheosis of the Romanesque and the Gothic arch, with a lantern that in spite of its classical columns and candelabra reminds us of a belfry studded with mysterious carvings. This archetype of a Baroque church is made of the stuff of Gothic cathedrals and is the ultimate perfection of Brunelleschi's pointed cupola.\n",

      "The story of how this festive picture came to be painted is very unusual. Cardinal Aldobrandini commissioned it as a sequel to Titian's Bacchanals which he had recently added to his collection. The comparison with such an illustrious model brought out the best in Domenichino, especially his ability to handle light, and spurred him to take a fresh approach. Unlike Titian, the Emilian painter was willing to avoid explosive use of colour and movement. Instead he seemed content to concentrate on a serene contemplation of the beauty of girls, animals, and the countryside.In his Diana Domenichino revived antique themes and the depiction of nymphs. The subject derives from Virgil's Aeneid (V, 485) where warriors are described competing in an archery contest and shooting a tree with their first arrow, a ribbon with their second and a falling bird with their third. It was probably Mons. Giovanni Battista Agucchi, major theorist and adviser on iconography at the time, who suggested transposing the subject matter into the realm of the nymphs led by Diana. The archery theme was adopted as a metaphor for shrewd arguments that hit the mark, which was topical at the time, as the dedication of the 'Dicerie sacre' by the poet Giovan Battista Marino to Pope Paul V indicates.In capturing nature in clear compositions that predominate over the use of colour, Domenichino nonetheless adopts Venetian tones now and then in the flowing d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries, and there are extraordinary passages from green to yellow, white to blue and various shades of purple. But what opens up a new chapter in the rendering of atmosphere are his gradual and calculated changes in tone towards the pale blue mountains by using increasingly subtle glazings, which indicate a new interest in Leonardo's theories on aerial perspective (studied and taught by the Theatine monk Matteo Zaccòlini, who taught Domenichino perspective in the 1620s).\n",

      "Central panel (157 x 180 cm): Coronation of the Virgin; side panels (117 x 40 cm each): St Jerome, St Francis, St Dominic, Mary Magdalene; upper panels, whose sequence has not been definitively reconstructed (49 x 38 cm each): St John the Baptist in the Desert, The Execution of St Peter Martyr, St Thomas Aquinas, St Francis Receiving the Stigmata.This polyptych was executed for the convent of Valle Romita at Fabriano around 1400. A familiarity with late fourteenth-century Lombard miniatures and graphic work undoubtedly was an important element in Gentile da Fabriano's training, as is indicated by the clear affinities between his work and that of Michelino da Besozzo. He was also influenced by masters of mixed tendencies, such as Barnaba da Modena and Taddeo di Bartolo, and more incisively by Venetian and Tuscan art.In the central panel the Virgin is shown being crowned by Christ, in the presence of God the Father and the Holy Ghost. The refined and delicate composition is made up of the three weightless figures — which seem to be disembodied in their d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries — and insubstantial elements, such as the radiant and flaming nimbus that supports the apparition of the Trinity. Curved forms — including the band of angel musicians, the contours of the figures of Christ and the Virgin, and the crowd of seraphim around God the Father — echo the arched shape of the panel.In the side panels the bodies of the saints also disappear within the fluid coils of their robes. There is a highly refined play of colour variations among the four figures. The red, white and gold robe of St Jerome and the pink and violet costume of Mary Magdalene contrast with the more sober brown of St Francis' habit and the black of St Dominic's mantle. St Francis' bare feet, an attribute of his iconography, are almost disconnected from the figure. The feet of the other figures remain invisible, hidden by their robes and the thick carpet of flowers.Indifference to the rendering of space and to the relative sizes of figures can also be seen in the smaller panels of the altarpiece. St John the Baptist and St Francis, shown kneeling in profile, are squeezed in among rocky peaks without regard to realistic proportions. Similarly, St Thomas is placed in a narrow garden, hemmed in by the wall and the door which emphasize the atmosphere of private meditation. St Peter's martyrdom, which is not very sanguinary despite the flow of blood, creates an impact by being brought forward toward the spectator.\n"

      "One of the best-known still-life painters of the 17th century, Juan FernÃ¡ndez was particularly admired for his paintings of g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s. He was an unconventional figure for his time in being an artist who lived in the countryside and worked the land, from which activity he derived the nickname by which he was best known, \"El Labrador\". However, in the later years of the 1620s, El Labrador became a protege of Giovanni Battista Crescenzi, Marquis of la Torre (1577—1635), the Roman nobleman and painter with a marked interest in still-life painting. Crescenzi may also have promoted his works among collectors at the court of Madrid, as well as the English ambassador Sir Francis Cottington and his secretary Arthur Hopton, who became aficionados of his still-lifes.El Labrador's flower paintings appear to have been the result of the direct intervention of one of his patrons. In February 1635, Arthur Hopton wrote to Cottington in London that he had persuaded the artist to try his hand at flower paintings, which he had not yet seen, in the hope that these would turn out as well as his fruit still-lifes. While the season of winter would not appear to be propitious to the beginning of a career as a flower painter, it is likely that El Labrador used his own cultivated blooms to paint these pictures. Hopton could not have been disappointed by the remarkable results of his patronage in paintings such as the Vase of Flowers (Private Collection) which El Labrador signed and dated 1636 on the reverse, or the flower piece reproduced here.In this piece El Labrador has painted the flowers in strong light against a dark background and this has almost bled the pink rose of colour in the highlights. The darkened, discoloured leaves at the base of the arrangement are due to chemical changes that can be seen in other still-life paintings by the artist, perhaps symptomatic of an insufficient artistic training. This floral arrangement, unusually, is made up of relatively few flowers: lilies, a pink rose and carnations.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/19_cent/tchaikovsky_nutcracker_waltz.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker, ballet suite, op. 71, Waltz of the Flowers</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

      "Poussin in old age was the grand old man of French painters in Rome. Esteemed by all and collected by discerning connoisseurs, he was revered as the man who had elevated painting to a much more serious plane than many of his Italian contemporaries, whose stature was often that of a decorator. In the early 1660s, however, a great change, which has to be described as a totally new phase, came over Poussin's art. Only a few pictures from this period survive, the earliest of which is probably the Landscape with Diana and Orion.The change is in the completely different handling of paint, which shows his preoccupation with surface texture, and a relaxation of mood. His sense of severity and order has disappeared and been replaced by a mood much more akin to the last works of Titian, such as the Diana and Actaeon in the National Gallery, London. In the New York picture the forms are less rigid than previously, and there is a return to the sense of rhythm last seen in his work of the 1630s. The landscape becomes a much more sensual interpretation of such types of painting as the Diogenes.In Greek mythology Orion was a hunter of gigantic stature. Drunk with wine he once tried to <font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> a princess of Chios, but her father punished Orion by blinding him. An oracle told him to travel east to the furthest edge of the world where the rays of the rising sun would heal his sight. On his journey he passed the forge of Vulcan whence he carried off an apprentice named Cedalion to guide him on his way. In due course Orion's sight was restored.Poussin shows the giant, bow in hand, striding through a wooded countryside towards a distant sea. Cedalion perches on his shoulders. Vulcan stands at the roadside pointing out the way. A cloud, wafting round Orion's face, suggests that his sight is veiled. Another myth tells how Orion eventually died at the hand of Diana who set his image among the stars. She is seen floating above him.\n"

FaÃ§ades with two towers tend to be the exception in the Netherlands.The character of the octagonal body of tower was established by Utrecht's Dom Church (Domkerk). Once the Netherlands' largest church, dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, it is one of the country's two pre-Reformation cathedrals, along with the cathedral in Middelburg, Zeeland. Begun in 1254 on the basis of the classic High Gothic cathedral (as e.g. Tournai or Cologne), this cathedral was given a huge west tower in the 14th century, which was built in front of the west end. The 112-metre-high Dom Tower is the hallmark of the city. In 1674 the central portion of the cathedral with the nave collapsed in a storm. The tornado split the cathedral in two.

      "Fish still-lifes developed as a category during the seventeenth century - not an astonishing phenomenon when we recall that fishing, particularly for herring and cod, was a mainstay of the Dutch economy. A notable exponent of the type is Abraham van Beyeren. As the Dutch love for flowers, their love for seafood is proverbial. The Haarlemer Joseph de Bray, son of Salomon and brother of Jan, celebrated this taste in his picture, dated 1656, dedicated to the apotheosis of the pickled herring.Resting behind the large, succulent herring and other objects in the painting's foreground, there is an elaborate tablet, d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d with a festoon of herrings and requisite onions, inscribed with a poem by the Remonstrant preacher and poet Jacob Westerbaen: 'In praise of the Pickled Herring' published in 1633. After telling of the herring's delight to the eye, palette, and its other qualities, Westerbaen adds that consumption of it 'Will make you apt to piss/And you will not fail/(With pardon) to shit/And ceaselessly fart...' - proof, if it is needed, that plain profane messages are as likely embodied in Dutch paintings as spiritual ones. The painting was evidently a success. In the following year he painted another, somewhat larger still-life, now in Aachen, dedicated to the same subject. It includes the text of Westerbaen's verse dedicated to the pickled herring, and a brief passage from his poem 'Cupido' on the page of an open folio accompanied by an ample display of herrings and onions.\n",

      "According to Roman legend, Lucretia, who was the wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, was <font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d by the son of the Roman king - a dishonour which subsequently resulted in her suicide. The event is supposed to have precipitated the collapse of the Etruscan royal line (510 BC) and thus to have led to the founding of the Roman Republic.In the 16th and 17th century Lucretia was frequently portrayed as a symbol of purity. Lotto presents us with the three-quarter view of a woman dressed in fine, richly trimmed clothes. Turned slightly away from the viewer, in her left hand she holds a drawing of the naked Lucretia about to stab herself in the heart. An inscription in Latin on the sheet on the table reads: \"Following Lucretia's example, no dishonoured woman should continue to live\".In the exquisiteness of its palette, the painting ranks amongst Lotto's greatest works. While the subject's face follows on from the tradition of Giorgione, the contrast between her brightly lit shoulders and the richly gradated reds and greens of her dress is worthy of a Titian. The costly pendant suspended from the gold chain, its precious stones refracting the light, is virtually without equal in 16th-century Venetian painting.\n",

      "Lippi probably received the commission for this painting from Monsignor Vitelleschi, the Archbishop of Florence from 1435 to 1437. Vitelleschi owned a palace at Corneto, and had close family ties to that city's Augustinian convent of San Marco, where Lippi's Madonna and Child seems to have once been housed. As a dated work it is an important monument for the reconstruction of Lippi's career. (The painting is dated on a card at the base of the throne which reads \"A. D. M. MCCCCXXXVII\")The painting is characterized by its spatial and perspectival structure, and a plastic quality in the figures that directly recalls the work of Masaccio. It documents a precise phase of the artists career before the influence of Fra Angelico became prevalent and before the artist began to distance himself from his interest in perspectival space.  Lippi painted this work after his return from North Italy, where more consistent contacts with French, German, and Netherlandish painting can be assumed. The close affinity between Lippi's style in this period and Flemish painting has led some scholars to hypothesize a voyage to Flanders in around 1435. If indeed Lippi did make such a trip, he would have come into direct contact with the work of Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden.The figures are substantial, especially the Child, whose large head, thick limbs, and heavy trunk are almost grotesque, as is the Child's inexplicable pose. The Madonna, with her nearly round head, a characteristic type for Lippi, her rigid right arm and squarish, stumpy hands with short fingers, and the ponderous, almost exaggerated d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries continue in his art. The perspective is also somewhat forced, but the sharply foreshortened upper shutter of the window is adventurous. Another effective feature of the painting is the vigorous light and shadow used both for building forms and for illumination within the interior space, although the source of light is not consistently distributed.\n",

      "In Rome, the restoration work on newly unearthed ancient statues was entrusted to sculptors; and as the collectors of this period wanted works restored to their original state (or what was believed to be their original state), restoration often involved carving missing parts. This practice provided artists with a regular source of income and an opportunity to measure themselves against the sculptors of Antiquity. Inevitably this work left its mark on their style. This was the case with Ignazio Collino, an artist from Turin and a protÃ©gÃ© of King Carlo Emanuele III who sent him to Rome at his expense.Collino studied ancient marbles in Rome, tried his hand at restoration, and became acquainted with French art. He made no secret of his classical leanings after he returned to his native city. The Sacrificing Vestal, this amply d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d female figure lighting or tending a flame on an altar, bespeaks a fascination with the antique, notwithstanding its characteristically eighteenth-century elegance and fluidity of line.Yet Collino is capable of conceiving large dynamic Baroque compositions.

In the inner ring two files of Apostles, led by Sts Peter and Paul and carrying golden crowns, move between garlands of flowers and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d curtains. In the centre of the dome above is a medallion depicting the Baptism.The composition of the dome mosaics reflects the emergent principles of Byzantine art in which architectural space is used as a unifying element in decoration. The two outer rings produce an effect of spatial illusion, and their airy quality is reminiscent of the mosaics in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia.Although the Baptism is dominated by its gold ground, the use of gold in the lower zones blends harmoniously with the other colours. The exquisite colour scheme of the Apostles' costumes, their tunics and mantles being gold and blue–white in an alternating sequence, exhibits a varied use of colour that is lost in later developments. On the columns in the ring below run stripes of gold tesserae, almost invisible to the eye but conferring a strong and shimmering light to the architectural scenery.\n",

      "In 1400 Wenceslas, King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, had a copy made of the Golden Bull - a version of the Empire's constitution - first issued in 1356. The copy is richly decorated and displays a number of the emblems of Wenceslas himself. We do not know what part political considerations played in the commission, nor how great a part was played by his enthusiasm for beautiful books. At all events, in the same year Wenceslas was deprived by the electors from his rank as emperor.Wenceslas commissioned several books in which acanthus foliage, armorial bearings, personal devices, animals, monsters and other decorative features tend to run riot around the text. Such conspicuous display of detail leaves the reader no doubt about the expensive nature of the manuscript; this and the feathery quality of the acanthus foliage makes most Bohemian court manuscripts easily recognizable. This volume is among the few that survived from his magnificent library. The picture shows the opening of the official copy of the Imperial Golden Bull.The text arranged in two columns is encircled by stylised acanthus leaves and scrolls. The light colours of the fleshy leaves appear like tongues of flames in the space they have created for themselves. A variety of tiny figures and animals painted from a close observation of nature, or derived from fairytales, are to be seen among the serpentine vines: birds, monkeys, a bear, a dog, a crouching monk, a \"savage\" in animals' skins who is holding a heraldic shield, girls dressed in light and loose garments, etc. In their shapes and colours these figures resemble the foliate ornaments, curving along with the vines. Indeed, the maidens' d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries are tied at the waist, and look like vines. On the other hand, the blue acanthus leaves in the round field in the bottom right turn into spilt water, where the tub has been turned upside down.Below the entangled foliate ornaments the motifs are compressed around a three-dimensional letter W, in which the monarch himself is depicted. The humorous detail with the bathing-women, a nearly nude female figure and towels tied into knots are, on the one hand, symbols of the Luxembourg dynasty and, on the other, of eroticism, referring to the love of the King and Queen, inspired by the plays of chivalric poetry. But, in addition to this, a romantic and Utopian desire for general physical and spiritual cleansing is also expressed in these representations (motifs of bathing) as well as for a return to the primordial state of mankind (the savage).The text of the Golden Bull begins with a prayer to the Creator (folio 1), which is illustrated by the Maiestas Domini on the right-side column. The figures of the Lord and two praying angels appear in a three-dimensional frame which seems to lift their figures from the sphere of the world of nature; nevertheless it does not break the homogeneity of the folio, because it gives the impression of being stretched between two green stems of the foliate decoration, while new shoots spring from its corners.\n",

      "There was a change in La Tour's style from the morbidity and mystery of such pictures as the penitent Magdalen contemplating a skull and a monk watching over his dead or dying companion, to works of a much calmer and more distilled air. The transitional pictures, also datable to the 1630s, are Job Mocked by his Wife at Ã‰pinal and the so-called 'Woman with the Flea' at Nancy.The composition of the Job is immediately striking. There is the same flickering movement that is found in the Payment of Dues, even though there are only two figures. It is derived from Bellange's etching of The Annunciation. an unexpected source, especially when it is considered that The Annunciation by Caravaggio was already in the ducal collection at Nancy by 1616 (this much-damaged picture is now in the MusÃ©e des Beaux-Arts at Nancy where it is accepted by most authorities as authentic). No influence on La Tour is discernible in the Caravaggio, although it is virtually certain that he knew it.The subject is a rare one, and La Tour has introduced a special pathos into Job's sufferings.Although its composition is a complex amalgam of the Bellange Annunciation, the mood of the Job is entirely original. La Tour has concentrated on a dialogue between the unfortunate Job and his ill-tempered wife, and has allowed us a glimpse of a rarely painted subject, a husband tormented by his wife. Her cruel mockery of him comes over with great force as Job sits helplessly contemplating his sores (the potsherd he uses to sc<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> them is on the ground). The spectator is forced to realize that this painter's genius lies chiefly in his ability to observe the human condition; his skill in painting candlelight is only part of the brilliance. Such a depiction of the complex relationship between two people is rare indeed in French art of the period, and in his maturity La Tour was to develop the concept of dialogue between people to ever-increasing heights of subtlety.\n",

      "At the period most churches were equipped with a pulpit from which homilies, sermons and announcements were given to the congregation. Hans Witten's conception, later dubbed the Tulip Pulpit, was uniquely biomorphic. Like a giant flower, its great stem seems to emerge from the ground before sprouting into a Eucharist chalice-like bloom. Small angels play amid its tendrils, and busts of the Latin Church Fathers (Ambrose, Augustine, Gregory and Jerome) ornament the basket. The sounding board above contains half-length figures of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child, who holds a cluster of g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s, accompanied by symbols of the four evangelists. Lions, alluding to the wisdom of Solomon, guard the steps. Thick vines, cut to mimic the texture of bark, and, almost hidden, a young man perched on a tree trunk support the stairs.

Fingering his rosary, he perpetually listens to words preached above, much like the devout who crowd around the pulpit mini contemporary images.\n",

      "The painting depicts the appearance of an angel to Valerianus and Cecilia, a young couple who had been converted to Christianity. Cecilia had taken a vow of chastity and had persuaded her husband to do likewise. Valerianus had suspected her of secretly being in love with his f riend Tiburtius but the angelic apparition allays his doubts while also heralding their approaching martyrdom.The composition - showing the three sumptuously dressed saints as they express with dignity their astonishment over the apparition of the angel - incorporates the main elements of Gentileschi's art. It represents a high point of his maturity, ranking with the Madonna of the Rosei family and the Annunciation in Turin. The disciplined, orderly construction has a Neoclassical stamp that derives from the artist's Tuscan background. The handling of the light shows the fundamental influence of Caravaggio, while the refinement of the surfaces in the gleaming satin and damask d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries and the soft warmth of the velvets are inspired by Bronzino.Typical of Gentileschi are the arrested gestures standing out against the opaque shadow of the austere interior; the figure of Tibertius, silhouetted against the light as he cautiously peers at the angel; the system of curves formed by the wings, the body and the long palm branch of the angel in flight; and the outstretched arms of St. Cecilia and St. Valerianus. The structural elements of the composition are striking: the link between Tibertius' hand and the angel's foot; the alignment of the palm branch and the organ pipes, and the wreath of flowers, St. Cecilia's hand and St. Valerianus' knee; and the parallels formed by the figures of St. Valerianus and St. Cecilia, the organ pipes and the door frame, the keyboard and the dais. Every element is brought into complex play in this highly articulated composition, from the tips of the wings and the palm branch to the edge of the red mantle, St. Valerianus' foot and the velvet cushion.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/17_cent/frescobaldi_ricercar.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Girolamo Frescobaldi: Ricercar No. 8</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

      "The process of populating the churches of Rome with statues and carved tombs continued at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and the sculptors' workshops were extremely active. (They even produced for export, e.g. statues were ordered from Rome for the Palace-Monastery of Mafra near Lisbon.) Sculpture was now firmly fixed in the style of Bernini. Camillo Rusconi, the Frenchman Pierre Legros (1666-1719) and RenÃ©-Michel (called Michel-Ange) Slodtz are among the sculptors most typical of this continuation of the Baroque.The tomb of Pope Gregory XIII in St Peter's is one of Rusconi's masterpieces. Like most such memorials in the early eighteenth century, it is subscribed to the basic formula of Algardi's tomb of Leo XI, albeit with Berninesque touches. Religion looks up to the figure of the Pope giving benediction as Fortitude lifts the massive d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry to reveal a sarcophagus with a relief commemorating the Gregorian emendation of the calendar.

Once again, the male portrait is more rugged and individualized, emphasizing military exploits and adventures. Francesco Maria poses alert in his stunningly rendered, glinting armor, his right arm and baton dramatically thrust out into the viewer's space. Behind him a splendid, plumed parade helmet, reflecting the vibrant, pulsating red of a velvet d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>, faces a jauntily angled set of lances. In marked contrast, Eleonora Gonzaga sits primly in her chair, immobile within her highly detailed but much less lovingly depicted court dress. Her pet dog lies bored on a table in front of a window.

      "There are two versions of the Virgin of the Rocks, one (the earlier) in the Louvre, Paris and another in the National Gallery, London.This version of the painting for the ancona (a carved wooden altar with frames where paintings were inserted) in the chapel of the Immacolata in the church of San Francesco Grande in Milan has distinctly sixteenth-century characteristics: larger figures, made more plastic by a very decided chiaroscuro so unlike Leonardo that scholars were immediately led to consider the work a collaboration. The canvas is generally considered the one that replaced the first version of the Virgin of the Rocks on the altar of the Immaculate Conception, after that version had been given to Louis XII. This version was then, in 1785, purchased by the English collector Gavin Hamilton. It was joined, in England, in 1898, by the two musician-angels of the De Predis brothers, and the three paintings are now displayed together in London's National Gallery.The picture substitutes a motif popular in Florence for the image normally required by Franciscan patrons promoting the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception: a Virgin without the Child, shown standing among prophets holding texts taken to refer to her exemption from Original Sin. In the Virgin of the Rocks the infant Baptist, sheltering under Mary's cloak, venerates the Christ Child in a cool, watery wilderness. The artist's Milanese clients must have worried about confusing the two infants, for a later hand has given John an identifying scroll and a cross clumsily rooted in one of Leonardo's exquisite studies of plants.The panel was inserted into a pre-existing frame, elaborately decorated with carving, gilding and painted shutters. (The two musical angels shown nearby, executed by an associate, probably come from the front and back of the right-hand shutter.) In the candlelit chapel the glittering frame and the painted rocks from whose shadows the figures emerge would have combined to suggest a mysterious cavern. In his notebooks Leonardo records a moment, when standing before the mouth of a cave, `Suddenly two things arose in me...fear of the menacing darkness... [and] desire to see if there was any marvellous thing within.' The contrast between the unfinished areas of the picture - such as the hand of the angel on Christ's back - and the finished passages would not have been as disturbing as it is now. Leonardo's intentions in this deeply emotional yet strangely uncommunicative work were perhaps most fully carried out in the angel's head and diaphanous veil, where the shimmering brushstrokes are of miraculous firmness and delicacy.The London version shows some details generally neglected by Leonardo in the other version: the haloes of the figures, the child Saint John's cross of reeds. Other elements which differ from the Paris picture are the pose of the angel, who no longer points his finger towards the little Paraclete, and his face, whose gaze no longer seeks out the spectator, but is directed inwards. The d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, too, which in the Paris version was heavy and concealed the body, is lighter here, revealing the anatomical structure. Also the rocks seem painted in a more plastic fashion; the light does not glide over them, creating dewy areas of semi-darkness, but leaves strong contrasts of light and dark. The flesh of the children here is less tender, and though the shadows are insistent, the children's faces seem flatter and less sweet than those of the two sublime creatures in Paris. The intervention of followers on the painting already sketched by Leonardo has made the portrayal less vibrant, more banal, though it retains a compositional authority and an originality in its variants that make this work not a copy but an autonomous version, of high quality, of the unequalled masterpiece in the Louvre.\n",

Yet, the composition is based on a terracotta relief by Luca della Robbia. The pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>t in front of the exquisitely refined figures, together with the shallow rectangular recess behind the gilt cloth, establishes the subtle and endlessly varied terms of Lippi's continuous dialogue between sculpture and painting on the one hand and between the illusionism of Renaissance painting and the ornamental qualities of Late Gothic painting on the other.\n",

      "Around 1560-61, Veronese was commissioned by Daniele Barbaro to provide the interior frescoes for Barbaro's Palladian villa in Maser. The construction of the villa to a design by Andrea Palladio was completed around 1558. The decoration reflects the taste of Daniele Barbaro, a cultured humanist, and his brother Marcantonio.Veronese decorated six rooms in the 'piano nobile' (the main floor) of the villa, as well as one wall of the last room of the eastern suite of rooms. The piano nobile is laid out in the shape of a double \"T\", the decorated rooms are: the Sala dell'Olimpo, the Sala a Crociera, the Stanza dell'Amore Coniugale, the Stanza di Bacco, the Stanza del Cane, the Stanza della Lucerna. The spacious Sala a Crociera (Cross-Shaped Room) connects the front and the two rooms to the south (the Stanza dell'Amore Coniugale and the Stanza di Bacco) with the large square room (the Sala dell'Olimpo) that opens onto the internal garden to the north. At the sides of the Sala dell'Olimpo are located  the rooms facing onto the courtyard (the Stanza del Cane and the Stanza della Lucerna).The frescoed scenes in the six rooms are supported and framed respectively by a system of decoration that, along with the white stuccoed molding of the door frames and fireplace, is not insignificant in determining the overall impression of the space. Floor to ceiling marble columns or pilasters subdivide the walls in all the rooms. In between, beyond low pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ts, one catches sight of far-off landscapes seen from high vantage points that compete with the views from the villa's windows.\n",

The painting depicts Christ blindfolded and being beaten by a band of grotesque men. The figures are thick-bodied, soft, and fleshy, done in a manner suggestive of the Italian High Renaissance. Elements of the work also show GrÃ¼newald's assimilation of DÃ¼rer, specifically his Apocalypse series. Different from High Renaissance idealism and humanism, however, are GrÃ¼newald's uses of figural distortion to portray violence and tragedy, thin fluttering d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, highly contrasting areas of light and shadow, and unusually stark and iridescent colour.

      "In 1565 the French Monsignor Matteo Contarelli acquired a chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, but when he died twenty years later it had not yet been decorated. The executor of his will, Virgilio Crescenzi, and later his son, Giacomo, undertook the task. The decorative scheme called for a statue of St Matthew and the Angel, commissioned first to Gerolamo Muziano, and then to the Flemish sculptor Cobaert, for the high altar; and for a fresco cycle for the walls and ceiling by Cavalier d'Arpino. The latter decorated the vault in 1591-93, but the walls were left bare (this may reflect at least in part the Crescenzis' intentions to speculate on the interest on the Contarelli estate). On 13 June 1599 a contract was stipulated before a notary by which Caravaggio undertook to execute two paintings for the lateral walls, for which he was paid the following year (1600), after the paintings had been set in place. Later, on 7 February 1602, after Cobaert's statue had been judged unsatisfactory, an altarpiece was entrusted to Caravaggio in a separate contract that called for delivery of the work by 32 May, the Feast of the Pentecost. This painting was rejected, the artist made another one (which was accepted) in a surprisingly brief time, receiving payment for this second work on 22 September.The first version of the St Matthew and the Angel was purchased by Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani and then ended up in Berlin, where it was destroyed in the Second World War. The second version (this picture) still stands over the altar today.The first version was a masterpiece of the artist. It contained, in the angel who with gentle indulgence guided the saint's uncertain hand as he wrote, one of the most charming figures ever painted by the artist. The first painting was criticised for Matthew's lack of decorum. In the final version, likewise a splendid feat of imagination but certainly less fascinating than the first, the angel much more correctly counts on his fingers, in the traditional scholastic fashion, the arguments than the saint should take note of and develop. A whirlwind of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry envelops the angel. The saint balances on his bench, in precarious equilibrium, like a modern schoolboy; but this time the unorthodox elements do not seem to have raised particular objections.\n",

      "Ambrogio Lorenzetti discarded Giotto's rigorous construction and incisive modeling in favour of open spaces, broadly articulated volumes, fluid composition and a colour range with many gradations. Contrary to Giotto's practice, he introduced subtle psychological effects. Note, in this painting, the intensity with which the mother and child look each other. The Virgin holds the Child with such delicacy that from a realistic point of view the support would be inadequate; the Child appears weightless. A lively detail is seen in the feet, escaping from the swaddling, which are not represented realistically but in terms of the linear cadences of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries.Probably intended for private devotion, this panel is an example of highly refined taste and skillful technique. On the gold ground the two large halos are indicated by a fine, incised line; the rectangularity of the panel is modified by the braided arch motif and by the flowers in the upper corners. The two figures are related to each other in a system of undulating rhythms and spiral movements. They widen or narrow with slow waverings in depth. Not a wrinkle mars the compact ivory of the faces and the Virgin's long, seemingly boneless hands.\n"

      "<i>Signature:</i> Not signed.<i>Provenance:</i>The catalog of the 1696 sale in Amsterdam enumerates three different tronies (one described as in antique dress) that may or may not be identical with this painting. Neither this young woman, nor the Girl with a Pearl Earring in the Mauritshuis, wears antique costume. People in the seventeenth century were sufficiently aware of Easterners, such as Turks, so as not to have mistaken a turban for an antique dress. The adducing of the Rotterdam sale, 1816, by Blankert, seems more probable. Certitude starts only with the painting's presence in the collection of Prince Auguste d'Arenberg, Brussels, 1829. Hidden during World War I (the d'Arenbergs owned vast estates in Belgium but had always retained their German citizenship. Hence, all their belongings there were seized after 1918 as \"enemy property\" and sold. The Vermeer escaped this fate), it was acquired by Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. Wrightsman, of Palm Beach, Florida, and Houston, Texas, in 1955. It was presented by them to the museum in 1979.This painting, as opposed to the Girl with a Pearl Earring, is very well preserved and permits us to judge Vermeer's approach, both technical and conceptual, in all its brilliance. Though more discreet, there is another pearl earring in this picture. The composition is also related to the other painting. Once again, we see this woman from the side, looking over her shoulder, though her face is turned further towards us. Her black hair is combed back severely from her forehead, and is plaited together with her (bridal?) veil. An additional variant is the position of her left arm, which is bent up against a pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>t. Vermeer is following a style of portrait which was introduced by Titian's Ariosto. We certainly do not have here a portrait, but again, as in the Girl with a Pearl Earring, a generalized type that communicates with the spiritual world almost as if in a trance. This part of the painting is delicately executed, while the light-blue robe or loose cloak that the young person is wearing has been more broadly and crisply treated.Interestingly, this painting was certainly the prototype that inspired the Girl with a Red Hat in the National Gallery of Art, Washington (According to some critics this painting is not by Vermeer but a later pasticcio.)This painting of Vermeer does not enjoy as much favour as the \"Gioconda of the North,\" although it is, in many respects, a much better picture.\n",

      "Bishop Neon decorated the interior with mosaics, dividing the interior surface into three zones of decoration.In the lowest zone eight columns are set into the corners and support arches decorated with mosaics of the Prophets. Mosaic inscriptions and marble revetment alternately fill the wall-spaces beneath the arches.In the second zone stucco arcades that may date from the building's foundation frame both the windows and the stucco aediculae that contain figures of 16 minor Prophets. This is in contrast to the absence of plastic articulation in the 6th-century churches of San Vitale and Sant'Apollinare Nuovo.Finally, the mosaic in the dome is divided into two rings and a central medallion. The outer ring contains an architectural frieze of eight compartments that alternately enclose altars and thrones. In the inner ring two files of Apostles, led by Sts Peter and Paul and carrying golden crowns, move between garlands of flowers and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d curtains. In the centre of the dome above is a medallion depicting the Baptism.The composition of the dome mosaics reflects the emergent principles of Byzantine art in which architectural space is used as a unifying element in decoration. The two outer rings produce an effect of spatial illusion, and their airy quality is reminiscent of the mosaics in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia.Although the Baptism is dominated by its gold ground, the use of gold in the lower zones blends harmoniously with the other colours. The exquisite colour scheme of the Apostles' costumes, their tunics and mantles being gold and blue–white in an alternating sequence, exhibits a varied use of colour that is lost in later developments. On the columns in the ring below run stripes of gold tesserae, almost invisible to the eye but conferring a strong and shimmering light to the architectural scenery.View the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/support/plans/zzzarchi/05c/3/neonian2.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=400,height=600');w.opener=this;w.focus();return false\">cross section</a> of the building.\n",

      "David, the political activist, was imprisoned in 1794. He survived the political change, and while still in prison planned a return to history painting and started work on The Intervention of Sabine Women, a project that was to occupy him until 1799. This subject, from ancient Rome, was the aftermath of the <font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> of the Sabines when, to ensure the population growth of their city, Romulus and his Romans abducted the womenfolk of their neighbours, the Sabines. Three years passed before the Sabine men, led by Tatius, mounted a counterattack. For the first time in a history painting by David, the central figure is a woman, Hersilia, who forces herself between Romulus, her husband, on the right, and the Sabine Tatius, her father, on the left. Other women cling to the warriors and place themselves and their children between the opposing groups.In this painting David contrasted the violence of the <font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> with the pacification of the intervention. The image of family conflict in the Sabines was a metaphor of the revolutionary process which had now culminated in peace and reconciliation. The painting was a tribute to Madame David, and a recognition of the power of women as peacemakers.\n",

The stable, symmetrical composition is typical of Luca's work, while the body of Christ, the toga-like d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, and the armour of the soldiers reveal how fully he had absorbed the classicism already demonstrated in the work of his fellow sculptors.Two sets of bronze doors for the paired sacristies of Florence Cathedral were commissioned from Donatello in 1437, but because he made little progress, the commission for one set was cancelled and in 1446 awarded to Luca della Robbia, Michelozzo, and Maso di Bartolommeo; the final payment for these doors was not made until 1475, when they were put into place. (Size of the doors: 420 x 200 cm, size of the panels : 53 x 53 cm each.) While the model for the panel of St Gregory the Great on the lower left has been attributed to Maso di Bartolommeo, the other nine were designed by Luca.The seated figures flanked by angels on the doors include Madonna and Child, the four Evangelists, and five other saints, including the patron of Florence, St John the Baptist.\n",

      "Medieval art reached a peak in around 1300, when a fundamental thematic renewal occurred. Artist were inspired by a steadily growing spirituality. Mysticism - in which the believer seeks to become one with Christ - ceased to be the privilege of ascetics, theologists and the educated, and was opened up to any Christian who wished to cultivate a personal, inner bond with God. Nuns played a key part in this process. Works of art expressing the mystic experience, such as the Jesus and John group, were primarily found in convents.This group was carved by Master Heinrich of Konstanz for the Dominican convent in Sankt-Katharinenthal (Switzerland). It is one of the finest and best-known, although not the oldest, of a smallish group of similar ensembles produced in the period for the region's convents.The carving shows Christ and St John sitting on a bench. John rests his head on Christ's chest, his eyes closed in devotion. His right hand rests in that of Christ, who places a loving arm around his shoulder.The actual theme of the piece is the inner unity of the two figures. The image expresses the loving submission of the disciple to the teacher and God's love of mankind. The artist conveys this spiritual dimension very convincingly. The two figures form a a single entity. No space is left between them, and the arm and hand movements seemingly cause them to merge. The subtle d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry is conceived in such a way that the robes virtually flow into one another, further heightening the unity.The motif has often been viewed as a prototype what are known in German as 'Andachtsbilder'. These are images which express a religious theme in a poetic and emotional way, free of any liturgical or theological context. They were designed to bring the viewer, through contemplation, to a state of identification with the portrayed figure or subject. Such images are typical of the 14th and 15th century and often belong to the sphere of private devotion. This Jesus and John group, by contrast, stood on an important altar in the convent church, where it functioned as a focus for the congregation. Nevertheless, it still undoubtedly served as an Andachtsbild. The bond shown here between Jesus and John represents the goal of every nun. The image can also be interpreted as an allegorical representation of the theme of the nun as a Bride of Christ. Its display on an altar might have had a eucharistic significance, too, by linking the spiritual nourishment of John's unification with Christ with the mystery of the Eucharist and the celebration of Mass.\n",

      "The exact identification of the names of the two painters, active in Umbria during the middle of the thirteenth century was discovered in 1948. The painting is signed and dated at the foot of the cross: \"Simone et Machilon pinserunt Hoc opus Anno Domini MCCLVII Domina Maria fieri Fecit\". Because it is one of the very few dated crosses from its period, this panel is an important reference point for the chronological reconstruction of thirteenth century central Italian workshop activity.Stylistically, the design follows the <a href=\"/html/g/giunta/crucifix.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/g/giunta/crucifix.html')\">Giunta Pisano Crucifix</a> in the church of San Domenico in Bologna, datable to around 1250 and the known prototype for a number of late thirteenth century crosses. This series has its finest expression in the Crucifix that Cimabue painted for Santa Croce in around 1287-88. Yet though they adhere strictly to the model of Giunta, especially in iconographic aspects, Simone and Machilone show some original characteristics, above all in the attenuation and hardness of line in the figure of Christ, less severe and more human in the National Gallery cross. Likewise, Simone and Machilone render anatomic details less schematically than their prototype. From Giunta, on the other hand, the artists inherit the languid abandon of the dead body of Christ, which they interpret with perfect mastery. Also masterfully rendered is the complex Hebraic d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry wrapped around the body, different from the brown d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry of Giunta's Christ, which provided the prototype for <a href=\"/html/c/coppo/cruci_sg.html\">another Cross</a>, attributed to Coppo di Marcovaldo, in the Pinacoteca of San Gimignano.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/14_cent/gregorian_chants.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Gregorian chants</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

      "The church of the Franciscan college San Buenaventura in Seville was adorned by a narrative cycle on the life of St Bonaventura, the renovator of the Franciscan order. Between 1626 and 1628 Herrera painted the four scenes describing the saint's youth, placed on the left wall of the nave; ZurbarÃ¡n was commissioned to complete the cycle, and executed four canvases illustrating the end of the saint's life.Dressed in the brilliant white robes of a bishop, grasping the cross in his folded hands, the body of the saint lies in state on a bier d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d in sumptuous brocade, with the red biretta of the cardinal at his feet. Pope Gregory X, who had appointed him cardinal bishop of Albano in 1273 stands, a white bearded man, beside the king, to whom he appears to be explaining the merits of the dead man. Most of the mourners, however, are simple Franciscan monks in their greyish brown habits, pensively praying or meditatively contemplating the dead man. He is indeed one of them, and the wan complexion of his tranquil face appears to mirror the dull hue of the habits. The great scholar and administrator of his order is here placed between the representatives of ecclesiastical and worldly power and the world of simple Franciscan brotherhood. He was accorded the title of \"doctor seraphicus\", meaning the \"brilliant teacher full of love\". This is what ZurbarÃ¡n paints: the teacher bound to practical life, his face filled with mystical desire even in death.\n",

      "It is Nicola Pisano, one of the sculptors/architects, whom Vasari in his Vite (Lives) credits with initiating the first of three stages of Renaissance sculpture. Nicola's first authenticated work, a signed pulpit for the Pisa Baptistry, justifies Vasari's choice. Dated 1260, it fuses southern and Tuscan elements into a truly original vision, reinforcing the consensus on the artist's unknown birthplace: he was probably born in southern Italy (in two documents he is referred to as \"de Apulia\") and may have either been trained in Pisa or worked for Frederick II before settling in Pisa.Precedents for Nicola's pulpit existed in the south from the previous century but they lacked the historiated (narrative) reliefs of the Tuscan tradition. Nicola's pulpit is indeed revolutionary: since it is freestanding it acts more like architectonic sculpture than a mere piece of liturgical furniture. Its shape is a function of its site. As a hexagon (symbolic of the Death of Christ), it echoes without being repetitive the adjacent earlier octagonal (symbolic of the Resurrection) baptismal font and harmonizes with the round shape (symbolic of rebirth, eternity and God) of the building.The pulpit's shape and the geometrical organization of its reliefs have been allied to the harmonious proportional ratios - associated since Pythagoras with the divine proportion of the cosmos - established by the contemporary Pisan mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci. In addition, the five reliefs (the sixth side was open for passage to the lectern) are separated by reddish brown Classicizing colonnettes. The classical manner in which they frame the white Carrara marble scenes leaves no doubt that Nicola was a talented architect and a sculptor of the first rank.The pulpit is supported by a central column on a base with grotesque figures and animals - representing pagan elements subdued by Christianity - and by six external columns. Three of these have bases set on the backs of lions hovering over vanquished prey, a Romanesque motif symbolic of triumphant Christianity. The columns are crowned by Gothic, quasi-Corinthian foliated capitals whose deep carving and drill work is akin to late Roman techniques. They support archivolts with trilobe Romanesque arches with inlaid cusps. Nicola carved prophets and the Evangelists in the spandrels and six nearly freestanding figures (five virtues and St John the Baptist, relating to the site) between the reliefs. Appropriately for the Baptistry, the scenes emphasize Christ's infancy, revelation of divinity and sacrifice. They are: a continuous narrative with the Annunciation, Nativity and Annunciation to the Shepherds; the Adoration of the Magi depicted as the Three Ages of Man; the Presentation in the Temple; the Crucifixion; and the Last Judgment. Traces of pigment suggest that paint once increased the polychromy of the coloured marble, while the addition of black paste to some drill holes intensified the light and dark contrast of the carving.Nicola's narrative panels are no less radical than the general layout of the pulpit. As was the Tuscan custom, figures dominate the scenes, but here they are unprecedented in their full height. In fact, the figures themselves create the space so that each panel resembles a Roman sarcophagus scene. Deeply undercut, they stand convincingly in front of each other. The weight of their features is heavy and their massive d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry both reveals their bodies and is separate from them. Their actions have a concentrated psychological realism and their forms are overtly sensuous. Unlike earlier sculptors who employed Classical motifs piecemeal like quotations, Nicola aimed at narrating the Life of Christ in a more integrated, naturalistic manner via a Classical style. While he borrowed from antiquity, he did so innovatively. For example, his massive Madonna is derived from the Phaedra on a sarcophagus in the Camposanto, Pisa. Her weighty form and Graeco-Roman head-dress as well as her heavy lips and chin are repeated throughout the pulpit with an Aristotelean unity of character. In both the Nativity, where she reclines like an Etruscan matron, and the `Adoration', the figure is not copied but rather studied and then mixed creatively with borrowings from other sources. More directly inspired from figures on the Phaedra sarcophagus are the wizened heads of the expressionistic prophetess Anna and St Elizabeth in the Presentation in the Temple. This scene also contains another fascinating adaptation all'antica, the transformation of a Hellenistic aged Dionysos supported by a satyr into the old priest with an acolyte. (Michelangelo used this general prototype later for his Bacchus.) Nicola adapted to a Christian context the pagan form derived from a Roman copy of a Neo-Attic carved krater in the Composanto. His borrowing also had a civic dimension because the krater was believed to have been given to the city by Augustus, thus alluding to Pisa's origins and alliance to the Ghibellines.\n",

      "This mural, removed from the wall of the church of Santa Maria at Tahull, is one of the most famous surviving examples of Catalonian Romanesque painting. The artist of this painting is referred to as the Master of Tahull.The rigid hieratic saints or Christs enthroned seen in earlier works are here replaced by a vivid and expressive representation of the fight between young David and the champion Goliath, who is depicted in chain armour and armed with a spear and shield. When the fresco was first made it included a scene in which David and Goliath were depicted side by side, David using his sling and Goliath slain by the stone. These details have been damaged beyond restoration and there remains only this scene in which David beheads Goliath. Here too the colours have faded in the course of centuries. In the Romanesque fresco we see the decorative manner of representation characteristic of the Mozarabic miniatures, that is to say, the fight is not shown as taking place in any particular landscape setting, but is depicted against a background divided horizontally by lines similar to the fesses of a heraldic escutcheon. There is also some of the crudeness seen in miniatures, for example, the exaggerated size of the hands. But the fresco represents a conscientious effort to depict the story with great accuracy, for these murals served not only to decorate the church but also to instruct the people in Biblical history.The artist clearly attempted to give the faces of David and Goliath certain individual features, introducing also such realistic details as the carrion bird beside the body, the lively d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry of the cloak and the Jewish cap on David's head.

      "This painting was first recorded as a work by Andrea Sacchi in a 1692 inventory of the collection of Pope Alexander VII's nephew Cardinal Flavio Chigi. It is the oil sketch for a larger canvas version (270 x 184 cm) of the same subject, once at the convent of S. Salvi and now at on deposit at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. According to Bellori, who describes the picture in precise detail, Sacchi's protector Cardinal Antonio Barberini commissioned it directly from the artist.Considering the highly unusual subject (the three Magdalenes: St Mary Magdalene of Japan, St Mary Magdalene and St Mary Magdalene dei Pazzi), this composition must have been designed for a particular place. A scenario was proposed in which the large altarpiece was sent in 1634 by Urban VIII to the Florentine Convent of Santa Maria Maddalena dei Pazzi, where the pope's two sisters lived as cloistered nuns from 1628 to 1639. The oil sketch differs in certain details from the larger Florentine picture. The most notable of the changes is that the putti, nude in the oil sketch, are covered by d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry in the altarpiece: evidently this was done out of a sense of decorum for the cloistered ambient for which the painting was destined. Painting just after Pietro da Cortona undertook the grand vault of the Palazzo Barberini, and during the years of the bitter polemical exchange between Sacchi and Cortona about the baroque style, this painting re-proposes a classical pyramid composition. In the picture the three figures, firmly defined in their space, acquire a solemn monumentality in their classic, measured gestures. A preparatory drawing, datable to 1633, is conserved at DÃ¼sseldorf.\n",

This central panel of the triptych represents Moses before the Burning Bush; the figures kneeling in prayer on the wing are the donor and his wife, Jeanne de Laval, accompanied by saints (not reproduced here). In this work the painter has abandoned the occasional crudities of The Raising of Lazarus; only in the countenance of Moses are there reminiscences of the more rigid portraiture of the earlier altarpiece. Moses is struck with astonishment at the vision before him and the appearance of the angel. The vision occupies the upper centre of the picture: amidst a great circle of flaming rose bushes the Madonna appears in a richly d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d mantle, holding the Child. Christ holds a mirror in his hand, in which both of them are reflected. The picture contains a number of emblematical representations.

Elsbeth holds her wedding ring and the clasp of her blouse is formed with the initials NT, presumably a gift from her husband.

      "The Annunciation in Santa Croce is the first work to reflect Donatello's new tendencies following his stay in Rome. \"It was put near the altar of the Cavalcanti Chapel. For this he made an ornament in the grotesque style, with a base of varied and intertwined work, surmounted by a quartercircle, and with six putti; these garlanded putti have their arms round each other as if they are afraid of the height and are trying to steady themselves. Donatello's ingenuity and skill are specially apparent in the figure of the Virgin herself: frightened by the unexpected appearance of the angel she makes a modest reverence with a charming, timid movement, turning with exquisite grace towards him as he makes his salutation. The Virgin's movement and expression reveal both her humility and the gratitude appropriate to an unexpected gift, particularly a gift as great as this. Moreover, Donatello created a masterly flow of folds and curves in the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries of the Madonna and angel, suggesting the form of the nude figures and showing how he was striving to recover the beauty of the ancients, which had been lost for so many years. He displayed such skill and facility that, in short, no one could have bettered his design, his jjudgment, his use of the chisel, or his execution of the work.\" (Vasari).The setting is elaborately classical - though the composition recalls iconographical precedents of the 14th century - and is richly decorated with lavish gilding on stone. The composition conveys a strong impression of the episode of the Annunciation: of an unlooked for gift received with serene grace. Other works of this period are inspired by an entirely different spirit.\n"

      "Verrocchio was a great sculptor as well as painter, one who also worked in relief and in precious metals. Such versatility is found even in two dimensions, for the painter's Madonna and Child has a sense of the oblique, of outreach and exchange. Exploration of landscape and an equally keen concern for light's passage and of chiaroscuro are often part of the painter-sculptor's concerns. Here, fascination for mysterious coils of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry and twisted veils, for the dynamic found even in the row of ties along Mary's sleeve, bespeak a new role for the artist, one enhanced by technical variety and virtuosity.\n",

The central area of the shrine displays a mandorla with Christ in Majesty, borne up by two symmetrical figures of angels. It is treated in the same way as the funerary portraits on Gallo-Roman sarcophagi, or the portraits on oriental ivories. This vision of Christ as a detached and powerful god was to prevail throughout Romanesque art. In form it is a transposition into sculpture of the gold altar frontals laid over wooden cores.

When the need arose, he cold also produce a striking performance, as in the splendidly imposing bust of Donna Olimpia Maidalchini, one of the greatest portraits of the period. Disagreeable and domineering, Donna Olimpia did not exude charm, but as the sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X she was a power in Rome during his reign. Algardi transmutes his unpromising sitter into an image of majesty and determination, the tilt of her head and the expression of her face being amplified by a billowing veil. Unusually, Algardi reverses the normal approach to flesh and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry tones by giving the latter a bright, milky sheen and leaving the former matt. This transposition was dictated by Algardi's emphasis upon the veil which is so integral to the bust's impact.\n",

      "Persephone (Proserpina for the Romans), the daughter of the corn-goddess Ceres, was picking flowers in a meadow with her companions when she was observed by Hades (also known as Pluto), the king of the underworld. Suddenly inflamed with love - according to Ovid he had just been struck by one of Cupid's arrows - Hades swept her away on his chariot. He caused a great chasm to open before them in the earth and Persephone was carried down to his kingdom below.The Persephone is a free-standing group, composed of three entwined figures carved out of a single block. Girardon is therefore here directly challenging comparison with <a href=\"/html/b/bernini/gianlore/sculptur/1620/proserp.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/b/bernini/gianlore/sculptur/1620/proserp.html')\">Bernini's treatment</a> of the same theme and with <a href=\"/html/g/giambolo/2/54giambo.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/g/giambolo/2/54giambo.html')\">Giambologna's <font color=\"ff0000\">Rape</font> of the Sabines.</a> Once again the statue does not now stand in the position for which it was originally designed. Until recently it was seen standing in the middle of the circular Colonnade, facing the entrance but inviting the spectator to walk round it and view it on all sides. It was planned, however, to form one of a quartet of groups at the four corners of the Parterre d'Eau. We do not know exactly how it was to be placed, but it would certainly have been set on a definite axis, so that it presented one principal aspect. Girardon has taken this fact into account and has designed the group with a marked emphasis on frontality. This feature is brought out most clearly by a comparison with the two Italian groups. Bologna's version presents satisfactory composition from whatever angle it is seen, but does not finally arrest the spectator at any one point. Bernini's is evidently meant to be studied primarily from one view, with the body of Pluto seen frontally, but there is such a wealth of cross-movement in depth that it can be examined from many sides. Girardon has concentrated everything on one view, to the extent that he has almost designed the statue as a high relief.\n",

      "The vogue for using monochrome marbles and composite materials for funeral monuments was shared by foreign artists who lived for extended periods in Italy. Slodtz, for example, sculpted an ambitious monument in Rome (though it was destined to be erected in the town of Vienne in France) memorialising two archbishops. In a kind of posthumous reunion celebrating their mutual understanding, the older beckons to the younger, Cardinal de La Tour d'Auvergne, to come and join him in the hereafter. In what is surely one of the masterpieces of eighteenth-century funeral sculpture, colour adds its glamour and appeal to the subtle modelling of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry and enhances the solemn spirituality of the scene.This combined tomb and monument was commissioned from Slodtz in 1740 by the Cardinal de la Tour d'Auvergne. The cardinal slowly mounts the steps, his hand held by his old mentor, Montmorin,, the earlier archbishop, who seems to have returned to life to indicate that the cardinal shall succeed him. Thus the monument unites those twin obsessions of the portrait and the tomb. Living and dead are brought into close contact, and the succession to the proud See of Vienne is expressed in terms more actual than allegorical. It is with the figure of the cardinal that Slodtz radically altered what would otherwise be merely a funerary monument. The cardinal is in fact a fully modelled statue of a living person placed on a tomb not as mourner but, as it were, in anticipation of his own death.\n",

      "This sculpture, called \"The African Venus\" by a French critic, was designed by Charles Cordier as a companion to a male portrait bust of a fictional \"Said Abdullah of the Mayac Tribe, Kingdom of Darfour.\" Both characters were modeled from life in Cordier's studio and were early examples of his determination \"to discover the different human types which come together to form a single people.\"Cordier's sculptures, which often incorporated coloured stone and precious metal finishes, stood in striking contrast to the white marble figures that embodied Victorian and Second Empire decorum. The effectiveness of such techniques may be seen in this reduced-scale bronze cast, in which warm skin tones are evoked by Cordier's use of a fine silver patina. The subject of an African Venus would have appealed to a predominantly male audience attracted by the myths of availability associated with women of foreign cultures. The model's heavy-lidded eyes, parted lips, and lightweight d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry reinforce such stereotypes, but the realism and carriage of the figure's head create a strong impression of individuality and dignity.\n",

His feminine figures, with some minor variants, all have a slender stature - narrow bust, frail limbs, fine hands - hair set in peaceful waves, a sweet face with smooth modelling and a broad flat forehead, eyes slanted towards the temples and circled by a fold of skin, a long nose and small mouth with a slight swelling of the lower lip. The masculine faces, built on the same plan, with, of course, thicker and more rugged features, present some distinct types found in many combinations in Riemenschneider's various works, as witnessed by the apostles of Rothenburg and Creglingen.

The curtain folds hang very convincingly over the canvas, casting a sharp shadow across the surface, and wrapping themselves around the tacked edge of the fictive unframed canvas.Some critics identified the sitter as Maria de' Medici, born in 1573, the daughter of Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici, and later Queen of France when she married Henri IV in 1600. In 1594, the year in which this picture was painted, Maria would have been twenty-one years old.

      "The small picture is an early work of the Master of the Votive Panel of Sankt Lambrecht, who for a long time was known to scholars by the name of Hans von TÃ¼bingen.In front of the golden background, which also extends over the frame, God the Father is supporting the tortured body of the dead Christ by His armpits. Though dead, Christ holds up His pierced right hand. The Dove of the Holy Ghost is hovering between them. Six angels are fluttering around the figures of the Holy Trinity, their gestures being directed towards Christ. The role of the Father is twofold. On the one hand, He is taking His Son back, thus accepting his sacrifice for mankind. Yet, the very same gesture serves to present and recommend this offering. This type of representation had developed in the surroundings of the French and Burgundian courts. In fact a tondo showing the same theme, by Jean Malouel, may have had a direct influence on the Vienna master. This is evinced not only by the iconographic resemblance of the two pictures; the memory of the round painting by Malouel may also have contributed to the composition of the Vienna panel. The representation seems to be opening up like a funnel from the green d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry of the bottom right corner. The helpless falling forward of the body of Christ appears to create a vortex, which sweeps the angels along too: it pushes away the one in the bottom right corner, while the one in the turquoise blue robe collapses backwards as though fainting. The symmetrical axis of the composition is the diagonal line running from the bottom right to the top left corner; the figures of Christ and of God the Father diverge at equal distances; the two angels in red also look like mirrored images of each other. The representation itself becomes condensed in the triangle under the other diagonal line.The almost tactile modelling of the bodies and the fact that not even the interpretation of the angels and of the Holy Ghost is stylized, but is based as much as possible on observed experience, are signs pointing to a further development of painting.\n",

      "Redesigning the Piazza del Campidoglio on the Capitoline Hill was one of Michelangelo's most successful architectural achievements and one of the most perfectly realized examples of Renaissance urban planning. Although the project was only partially completed in his lifetime, the engravings published by Etienne DupÃ©rac in 1568 and 1569 made it possible in later centuries to follow the general lines of his design.Initially Michelangelo was asked to design a base for the ancient equestrian statue of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, which Paul III had moved from the Lateran to the Capitoline in 1538. His choice of an oval base is echoed in the oval pavement (from 1561). The triangular, double-ramp staircase in front of the Palazzo Senatorio (restored 1984) was carried out in 1544-52, but it would have been uncharacteristic for Michelangelo to adhere to fixed overall designs for over 30 years. After the election of Pius IV in 1559, the monumental stairway ramp (cordonata) up to the Piazza del Campidoglio was built and the oval steps around the piazza put in place. The year before Michelangelo's death, the faÃ§ade of the Palazzo dei Conservatori was started according to a new set of drawings produced under his supervision, and the building was completed (1568-84) by Giacomo della Porta. The construction of a palazzo of the same design across the square, the Palazzo Nuovo, which established the symmetry of the composition, followed in 1603-60.The Palazzo dei Conservatori's giant order of Corinthian pilasters on high pedestals gives the faÃ§ade its immensely powerful character, culminating in a sculpture-crowned balustrade, which dissolves the skyline. A minor order of Ionic columns on the ground floor supports monolithic stone beams, the wide intercolumniations producing effects of dense shadow. The composition is a dramatic opposition of verticals and horizontals, in which the pilaster order is laid like a grid over wider brick piers that form the structural support. Few Renaissance buildings convey such a powerful sense of structural forces at work.As completed according to Michelangelo's design, the t<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>zoidal piazza has strictly symmetrical flanking faÃ§ades and an oval central space and statue podium, which serve to divert circulation to left and right towards the Palazzo Senatorio staircase. The pattern on the pavement tends to magnify the effect of the statue.Etienne DupÃ©rac's engraving from 1569 shows (right) the faÃ§ade of the Palazzo dei Conservatori (after 1561), with (left) the Palazzo Nuovo (built 1603-60 to the same design) and (centre) the staircase to the Palazzo Senatorio (1544-52).\n",

      "The Return of the Herd is one of a cycle depicting the months, five paintings of which have survived. This picture presumably depicts November.Many of Bruegel's paintings show people not so much as the masters of nature but rather as a part of it: there is hardly any difference here between the coloration of the cattle and that of their drovers. November is the month in which the cattle return to their winter quarters from the summer pastures and Bruegel shows them being driven towards the hill-top village. In this panel Bruegel's remarkable technique can be studied at its best. Individual forms are built up with the greatest economy. Within the sketched outline the paint is laid on thinly, sometimes with an almost dry brush. The light brown gesso underpainting is allowed to show through, in this instance giving a warm brown tone to the whole foreground. Bruegel must have composed the Months largely on the panels themselves; only one preparatory drawing on paper survives, a study for one of the hunters in The Hunters in the Snow, the January panel. Having prepared the panel, Bruegel drew the outlines of the composition in paint with a thin brush and then added the thinly-sc<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d areas of colour within those outlines.\n",

      "The tomb monument of Cardinal Brancacci (most likely related to Felice Brancacci, the commissioner of Masaccio's and Masolino's frescoes in the Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence) is the work of Donatello and Michelozzo, carved largely in a workshop Donatello set up in Pisa and then assembled in Naples. It is a mix of Florentine and Neapolitan elements, an exported style conforming to local traditions. The classical, fluted columns, paired pilasters, classicising caryatid figures carrying the tomb chest, and the schiacciato relief decorating the chest are characteristic Florentine art, but the shape of the tomb with its baldachin-like architectural frame and the angels standing behind the figure of the dead cardinal and pulling apart the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries as if to reveal it are typical of Neapolitan tombs.The work was presumably started in Rainaldo Brancacci's lifetime who died on 5 June 1427. It is not innovative to the same extent as the anti-pope monument in Florence, and it is likely that Michelozzo was mainly responsible for its design and construction. Only the relief of the Assumption of the Virgin can definitely attributed to Donatello.\n"

      "Theodoric's most impressive monument was his two-storey mausoleum in Ravenna which is built entirely of large blocks of ashlar surmounted by a domed single block, a feat of engineering skill that may have been carried out by Isaurian builders who are recorded in 6th-century Thrace, Constantinople, Syria, and the Holy Land.Built before or around the time of Theodoric's death in 526, this unique building demonstrates the remarkable degree of artistic originality that persisted in Ravenna while it was still an Ostrogothic town. It is a two-storey structure built of huge blocks of ashlar without mortar and crowned by a flat-domed monolithic roof (diameter 11 m) weighing c. 300 tonnes.Externally each of the ten sides of the lower storey has a deep arch resting on half piers. The upper storey is decorated with an unfinished ring of colonnettes and alternating semicircular and t<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>zoidal arches; 12 pierced spurs are set around the edge of the dome's drum.The interior comprises a cross-shaped vaulted chamber on the ground floor; a porphyry bath was reused as the royal sarcophagus. Since the tradition of stone building and the use of double-storey tombs had survived in the 6th century only in Syria and Asia Minor, Theodoric probably employed a group of Eastern masons to construct his mausoleum.\n",

      "This depiction of fruit and vegetables signed by Pietro Paolo Bonzi is the pendant of another signed painting also once in the Wetzlar collection. The pendants are two of the artist's three securely attributed still-lifes and as such form the cornerstone of our knowledge of Bonzi's oeuvre in this area and a point of departure for any further enlargement of it. His only other documented still-life is the famous decoration with swags of fruit, flowers and vegetables painted in the vault of the gallery of the Palazzo Mattei in Rome, which was commissioned by Asdrubale Mattei and executed with Pietro da Cortona in 1622-23. In May 1626, Marchese Mattei also commissioned two paintings with assorted fruit and five 'all different' flower paintings from Bonzi. In Asdrubale's 1638 posthumous inventory three paintings are listed as `birds by il Gobbo'. These and a few other documents attesting to his activity as a still-life painter reveal unequivocally that Bonzi was an artist who paid close attention to the natural world. His ability to render fruit in a naturalistic manner was transmitted directly to his only pupil named in the sources, Michelangelo Cerquozzi.Works such as Bonzi's Fruit, Vegetables and a Butterfly opened the path for Cerquozzi's luxuriant and exuberant baroque still-life paintings. The artichokes, celery, pears, melon, slice of water melon, bunch of red strawberries, cherries, peaches, hazelnuts and figs on a stem, plus the two bunches of precariously piled white g<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>s, justify Giovanni Baglione's statement that Bonzi, 'with his fruit caught the eye and deceived the spectator'. Here Bonzi's skill at optical illusion, his ability to outdo reality - the artichokes and figs would surely fall if gravity's laws were obeyed - are sustained by his artistic talent.\n",

      "Isaiah is altogether different in character. He seems to listen intently. His forehead may express bewilderment yet he is clad in the green cloak of hope. As he listens, his genii point excitedly into the distance whence the great voice addresses him. The powerful left arm is raised as though commanding stillness or silence. He has an intimation of the mystery of the Son. The naked feet are crossed, and the entire figure expresses veneration, expectation and readiness. What is the significance of the half closed book which he marks with his inserted finger? Surely, that the book is nothing; books may fail, the voice alone is infallible. Note how the contours of the figure form a circle from which only the head and one hand emerge. The left arm, the left hand, and the head together with the genii, describe an oval superimposed on the circle. The face, with lips parted in expectation, bears an expression of rapt attention; the hair of indeterminate colour, and the vigorously drawn neck emerging from light-toned d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries in blue, green and red, symbolizing faith, hope and charity, indicate that this exalted figure is poised on the threshold of two worlds; it is intent of hearing, it is rapt in attention, and its genius points at Noah's offering.Above the Prophet to the left we see an ignudo with a jubilant expression.

      "The French Simon Vouet triumphed in Rome by becoming president of the Academy of St Luke in 1627. He painted the Birth of the Virgin for the San Francesco a Ripa with an uncommonly powerful sense of composition.During his first visit to Rome Vouet seems to have produced many paintings in a picturesque style, either of swaggering bravo figures, or portraits in the same guise. Later he was to take up Charavaggio's use of chiaroscuro, but in a very personal manner, particularly in the present Birth of the Virgin.Birth of the Virgin is an unusually original version of Caravaggio's style, novel in its broad, low composition, bold in its foreshortenings, and striking in its handling of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry.

      "Signed and dated on the quiver in the lower right corner: Simon Vouet F. Paris 1637 (the date has previously been incorrectly read as 1627).The artist had been a leading painter in Rome and in 1624 was elected President of the Accademia di San Luca. His style there oscillated between the Caravaggesque, Roman baroque and Bolognese classicism. On his return to Paris he gained a reputation as a decorative artist, indulging in skilful displays of illusionistic painting including the ceiling of the principal room in the château at Colombes where Henrietta Maria (the wife of Charles I) lived from 1657. Vouet was undoubtedly the most influential artist of his generation in France (beside Poussin who spent much of his life in Rome) and was active in establishing the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux-Arts in 1648, one year before his death.Diana is in Vouet's late, more classical style. The idealised expression of the face with its widely spaced features, the languid gesture, and the slow, ponderous rhythms combined with the pale flesh tones and light colours of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry are typical of the artist's decorative work. The composition was originally oval, as seen in an engraving of 1638 by Vouet's son-in-law, Michel Dorigny. With this knowledge the internal rhythms of the painting become more comprehensible, with the curve created by the reclining figure of the goddess of hunting continued in the muzzles of the two dogs pointing in opposite directions.Dorigny also engraved two other oval compositions in 1638, Venus and Adonis and Mars and Venus, which could have formed a series with the present painting. The pose is reminiscent of Venetian painting (for example, Venus and Cupid by Palma Vecchio - Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum). Vouet had visited Venice in 1612/13, but evidence of his interest in Venetian art resurfaces in several of the decorative schemes undertaken after 1627, especially in his masterpiece in the Hotel Seguier, Paris. There is also an affinity with Primaticcio's work carried out at Fontainebleau for Francis I at the beginning of the sixteenth century, which was widely known through engravings.\n"

      "Saint Catherine's Monastery lies on the Sinai Peninsula, at the mouth of a gorge at the foot of Mount Sinai, near the town of Saint Catherine, Egypt.Built between 548 and 565, the monastery is one of the oldest working Christian monasteries in the world. The site contains the world's oldest continually operating library, possessing many unique books.The monastery is surrounded by walls (height 12–15 m), which date mainly from the 6th century, they served not only for the monks' protection but also as a garrison against the Arab incursions into Palestine. Their upper sections collapsed after an earthquake in 1312 but were restored in 1801 by Marshal KlÃ©ber on the instructions of Napoleon.Within the t<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>zoidal enclosure (85 x 70 m) stands a basilical church built of local basalt. It has gabled ends and two towers flanking the west faÃ§ade. The names of Justinian, his consort Theodora and the builder Stephanos of Aila on the Gulf of Aqaba are inscribed on three of its roof trusses.The wide central nave is separated from the two adjacent aisles by twelve free-standing columns, six on each side, surmounted by capitals carved in the local stone. Eight chapels, four on each side, adjoin the aisles, at whose east ends stand two 6th-century doors sheathed in their original bronze: they give access to two square, domed chapels flanking the main apse. Between these chapels and behind the apse is the chapel of the Burning Bush covering a courtyard where the Bush was supposed to have grown.To the north of the church is a two-storey oblong building which originally served as a guest-house but was converted to a mosque in 1106. The other conventual buildings are of a later date and include several chapels, a refectory and a library.The monastery complex houses irreplaceable works of art: mosaics, the best collection of early icons in the world, many in encaustic, as well as liturgical objects, chalices and reliquaries, and church buildings.\n",

      "The polyptych of St Vincent Ferrer, executed for the altar dedicated to the saint in the Venetian basilica of St John and St Paul, is Bellini's first public assignment. It comprises nine panels arranged in three parts: above the Pietà with the Virgin and the Angel of the Annunciation at the side; in the centre the titular saint with St Christopher and St Sebastian at the sides; in the predella five miracles of the saint. Formerly the painting was crowned by a lunette which is lost.Champion of the Dominican Order, ardent and threatening preacher and controversialist, early confessor and later bitter adversary of Benedict XIII, the Spanish saint had been sanctified in 1455 and immediately the Order had committed itself to a vast campaign of propaganda and assertion of the cult.The looming figures of the central register, furrowed by the lines of their bodies and d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, are emphasized by a brilliant light shining from below. The measure of their perspective is expressed by one or two basic elements: the arrows of St Sebastian, the stout staff of St Christopher in the foreground. Above, the Christ in Pietà (which, as always, faithfully follows a Byzantine iconographical model) is enclosed between an announcing angel and a Madonna with extremely limpid colours. In the angel, especially, the colours are blended with an almost glassy quality, and their pallid and alabastrine splendour contrasts with the sudden blaze of red curtain behind the Virgin. The space is suggested by small details in an almost unnoticed and yet essential way: the deep dark folds of the curtain, and the sharp cold corner of the marmoreal pillar.\n",

      "The artist of this painting is referred to as Master of Salzburg.In this picture the scene of the Nativity is represented according to an apocryphal story of the Gospel: the Virgin is reclining on her bed while two midwives are on the point of giving a bath to the Infant. The woman in green is taking the Child from His mother, while the other is taking care that the bathwater is at right temperature. The bath puts an emphasis on the human aspect of the divine Child and is a hint to baptism. Joseph is seated on the right-hand side deep in thought. He holds his staff with his left hand, and is supporting his head with his right hand. The ox and the ass at the manger in the back seem to warm the straw and the small cambric kerchief with their breath.In addition to some stylistic resemblances the painting is reminiscent in other respects too of the Trebon Master's picture of the same scene. In both pictures the composition is divided by the building of the stable, with the difference that here the supports of the stable look like the frame of the scene represented, and divide the surface into two parts and not into three. In both pictures the supporting pole, emphatically placed in the foreground, separates Joseph, who views the events from the back and plays a role similar to the spectator's. In this picture too we can see birds on the roof of the stable, but they are shaped more firmly and realistically (as are the figures) than in the work of the Master of Trebon.In spite of the simplicity of the presentation and the somewhat rugged shaping of the figures with their rather large heads the susceptibility of the International Gothic style to elegance and decorative patterns evinces itself in this painting too. The elegance can be seen in the buoyant lines of the d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries, and in the Virgin's mantle, which clings to her body as if it were wet; the decorativeness in the way in which the painter has used the opportunities inherent in the rustic surroundings, and brought into harmony the pattern of the thatched roof, the mat and the fence, which are made of similar materials, and there is an additional harmonious touch in the plaited hair of one of the midwives.As in a great many other pictures of the period the ground is exceedingly steep here; compared to the figures in the foreground the stable seems to be high, on the other hand the beam underneath the roof touches the animals' heads. Although the white piece of cloth between the two midwives-in all probability a napkin, another symbol of the human nature of Jesus-looks as though it were hovering, in fact it lies on the ground. All this is not surprising, since these forms do not convey space, they are meant, first and foremost, to fill up the surface of the picture.\n"

The Apollo especially is a conscious echo of Bernini. This is sculpture vigorous and robust, fully modelled, with the emphasis on action and space - the space of the open air. The pose has to be immediately effective when approached from several angles, glimpsed against a background of trees, or, as in the case of Apollo, made the centrepiece of a fountain. Just as Marly itself represented rural freedom in comparison with Versailles, so this garden sculpture escapes from any requirements of state or religion. For such sculpture, so quickly to grow weathered, a finished surface was not required. A coarser texture is responsible for the animation of surface, with bold, wind-blown d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries and muscular bodies, and with an energetic drama of expression. A momentary action, in which gestures almost speak, is seized upon, with a preference for the natural over the dignified.

The suggestion that the subject is probably a folk tale of the Adriatic coast of Italy seems the most plausible.DÃ¼rer loved a good tale, especially if it included weird elements. It has been suggested that DÃ¼rer heard some current story about the <font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font> of a young girl by a monster who came out of the sea. Fascinated by various elements suggested by ancient tales, he mingled them in this scene.The magnificent, shapely young woman who had apparently been bathing with her friends (who now seek shelter on the far bank) is being carried off by a strange, bearded creature, half human, half fish. She does not seem too reluctant to leave family and friends; nor does the sea monster appear evil in fact, he hardly seems to notice his voluptuous cargo. The rest of the scene shows nature at its most serene. Elaborate buildings nestle on the hillside or are perched on the heights. In the foreground DÃ¼rer creates an arabesque of small waves, and completes it with a charming rendering of grasses growing on the shore.The female figure is the core of the composition. The maritime abduction simply serves to legitimise her nudity. Surely based on an Italian model. The surrounding fairy tale was obviously tailored to serve DÃ¼rer's purpose. The audacious, diagonally descending line of the background is unprecedented. No other engraving of this time has the decorative beauty of this one or the effectiveness of its black and white.

      "This painting, the latest and grandest of Poussin's three versions of the theme, was acquired by the National Gallery jointly with the National Museum of Wales in 1988 and is shown alternately in London and Cardiff. Poussin illustrated events from the life of Moses at least nineteen times. It has been pointed out that when he could, he avoided painting scenes of saintly visions or martyrdoms, the stock-in-trade of seventeenth-century religious art. He concentrated instead on the central themes of Christianity, relating them both to their historical context in the ancient Near East and to the basic tenets of other religions, following an intellectual fashion of the day. Of the Old Testament subjects which he painted, the majority belong to the category of types, or prefigurations, of Salvation.From Early Christian times the Old Testament was read by Christians for its analogies with the New. Thus the waters of the Nile to which the infant Moses is consigned by his mother in 'an ark of bulrushes', following Pharaoh's cruel order to drown all the male Israelite babies (Exodus 1:2), were likened to the waters of baptism. But Poussin's interest in Moses may have been prompted also by his identification with pagan deities; as a contemporary writer influenced by these ideas wrote of this picture: 'He is Moses, the Mosche of the Hebrews, the Pan of the Arcadians, the Priapus of the Hellespont, the Anubis of the Egyptians.'All these ideas reverberate throughout the painting. The baby on whom Pharaoh's daughter has taken pity resembles the Christ Child blessing the Magi or the shepherds in a scene of the Adoration. In the background on the left an Egyptian priest worships the dog-shaped god Anubis (barely visible now that the surface paint has grown thin and transparent). We know we are in Egypt because on the rock above the main scene a river god, symbolising the Nile, embraces a sphinx, palm trees stand on the shore and an obelisk rises up behind a stately temple. (Curiously, the many-windowed buildings with which Poussin, who had never been there, endows Pharaoh's country now resemble modern resort hotels.)The main interest and beauty of the painting, however, do not reside in its possible symbolism, but in the wonderful grouping of the figures, all women to contrast with an analogous group of men in Christ healing the Blind Man (now in the Louvre), painted for the same patron the year before. Each plays her role in the dramatic tale, the princess generous and commanding, the maids curious and delighted. The humbler figure in a white shift at Moses' head may be his sister who watched from nearby to see what would happen to him, and recommended their mother to Pharaoh's daughter as a wet nurse. It is tempting to see their brilliant d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries as a compliment to Poussin's patron, the Lyon silk merchant Reynon. Bodies and colours, each distinct and separate, combine in ample rhythms across the picture surface, echoed by the rocks beyond. It is at once solemn and joyful, as befits a scene in which a child is rescued from death, and through him an entire people is saved.<table align=\"LEFT\" bgcolor=\"#99CCCC\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"320\"><tr valign=\"MIDDLE\"><td><img border=\"0\" src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" valign=\"MIDDLE\"/>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 5 minutes):<br/><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/19_cent/rossini_moses.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><b>Gioacchino Rossini: Moses, Moses' Prayer</b></a></td></tr></table>\n",

      "In France there is archaeological evidence for the continuous use and construction of separate baptismal buildings. The most famous baptistery in France, Saint-Jean at Poitiers, situated c. 100 m south of the cathedral, is the best-preserved structure to survive from Merovingian Gaul, although its origins lie in the Gallo-Roman period (4th century). In its present form it consists of a rectangular core (12.5 x 8.25 m) with a polygonal narthex on the north-west side, semicircular apses on the lateral sides, and a polygonal apse set into a t<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>zoidal projection on the south-east. The baptistery is orientated south-east, but since its lateral sides are considerably shorter than the others, they are treated like faÃ§ades and carry gables. This unusual transverse orientation was dictated by the retention of earlier constructions against the north-west face when the baptistery was rebuilt in the Merovingian period.The history of the building is extremely complex. The Merovingian campaign involved an almost complete reconstruction of the superstructure. Apses were constructed against three sides of the pre-existing building: the surviving polygonal apse on the south-east face and square apses on the lateral faces. To the north-west a rectangular chamber, preceded by two secretaria (sacristies) flanking an entrance porch, was retained from the Gallo-Roman period. The Merovingian reconstruction is not precisely dated, but it has been convincingly attributed to the episcopacy of Ansoald (674-96). Repairs apparent in the exterior facings, the transformation of the windows into oculi, the substitution of the square lateral apses for semicircular ones and the replacement of the chambers on the north-west side by a polygonal narthex have been variously attributed to the Carolingian or Romanesque periods. The two lateral apses were rebuilt in the 19th century.The patchy exterior facings have retained their Merovingian decoration, including a band of opus mixtum, pilasters with crudely carved capitals, and tympanum-, stele-, and pediment-shaped stone panels carved in shallow relief with compass-drawn rosettes, crosses, or foliate motifs.During the Middle Ages the baptistery was used as an abbey chapel and parish church, in 1836 it was transformed into a museum, a function it has fulfilled ever sinceView the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"w=window.open ('/support/plans/zzzarchi/07c/2/poitiers.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=400,height=600');w.opener=this;w.focus();return false\">ground plan</a> of the building.\n"

      "In the years around 1640, the successful Antwerp artist Jordaens painted a number of works with mythological scenes that differed strongly from his previous production, both in terms of dimensions and the relationship between figures and landscapes. The present work uses the Antwerp cabinet-painting format, a comparatively small size of picture for Jordaens that follows in the tradition of Frans Francken II, Hendrick van Balen and Jan Brueghel the Elder. Diana and Actaeon is the first example in Jordaens's oeuvre in which landscape came to assume an importance of its own, becoming as significant in the painting as the historical scene with its small-scale, almost incidental figures. This painting must be seen as one of the most important examples of this group.Fully in keeping with Ovid (Metamorphoses, III, 138-252), the hunter, who is on the left, carrying a spear and followed by his dogs, is dressed to great effect in a length of red cloth. Separated by no more than a narrow stretch of water flowing along the lower edge of the painting we see the naked figures of Diana and her companions, almost in a direct line before the hunter and seemingly lined up for the viewer. The blatant nudity of these delightful, voluptuous women departs strangely from Ovid's descriptions, in which, upon their discovery by Actaeon, the surprised nymphs try to cover and hide themselves.In Jordaens's composition, Diana and her companions seem to have frozen somewhat half-heartedly into droll poses; after all, the depiction of the und<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>d female body was the major reason for the artist's choice of this subject. So Jordaens makes the most of his opportunity, and depicts the women caught performing their post-hunt ablutions in ten different positions, some curiously bent, some standing, and some crouching. With this group Jordaens demonstrates his prowess in painting the nude.\n",

Various animals and birds perch and scuttle around amongst the fruit.This work is an impressive display of opulence. The artist brings the objects close to the beholder by cutting off the heavy, crumpled rug at the edge of the work. The piece is characterised by such dynamism that it almost contradicts the definition of \"still-life\": The blue and white porcelain dish is precariously tilted, the apple on the left almost falls from the table, a bird clings upside down from a slender vine branch. The sumptuousness of the arrangement is emphasised by the heavy blue curtain in the background, an attribute of courtly representation.The vivid colours also underline the feeling of opulence: The blue parrot presiding over the scene, the shiny red apples, the yellow lemon peel, the green birds. However, the bright colours were not simply chosen for their own sake, but serve to convey the textures of the objects depicted, such as the pink of the fluffy peach skins or the yellow of the slightly wilted vine leaves.The painting is signed and dated lower left: B.

Bernini created a spatial relationship that enlivened the entire chapel, turning its classical form to a new religious use.The sculpture of Daniel shows the characteristic elongation of the body which is typical of Bernini's so-called late style.

      "Sanchez Cotan studied in Toledo and here he established the prototype of the Spanish still-life composed mainly from vegetables.Everyday objects: a melon, cut open to reveal its pale pink flesh, a knobby cucumber, a yellow quince that is past its best, a cabbage with thick leaves. Parallel to the picture plane, a smooth frame delineates the opening for a window. From the direction of the spectator, light falls upon the pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>t, on which the slice of melon and the cucumber are placed so that they jut over slightly and thereby they seem to be almost within reach - a trompe l'oeil effect that was particularly popular in Netherlandish painting in the 17th century. The head of cabbage and the quince, suspended on threads that presumably have been attached to the upper frame, are dangling over the gaping darkness.Even if the objects are arranged so that they seem close enough to touch, they are nevertheless distanced. For all the naturalism with which they are depicted, the isolation of each object, heightened further by the black background, makes each of them seem extremely artificial and lends them a monumental, almost sculptural gravity. The centre of the picture is empty and the arrangement seems coincidental; the dimension of the painted picture is denied. The disturbing evocation of the painted picture is the main theme.\n",

      "The Last Supper is remarkable for its stylistic purity and sobriety. The faces of the apostles do not vary greatly. Their gestures seem to have been frozen at a particular point in time. It is an important moment, and those present seem to be meditating on its significance. This superbly glacial and hieratic aspect of the style contrasts with other elements that are equally present, and more down-to-earth, prefiguring the realism of a Van der Goes. Two honest servants in the far left hand corner of the room are observing the proceedings through a hatch from the kitchen. Together with another figure - who may represent the painter himself and who stands by ready to wait on Christ and his disciples - they serve to place this momentous scene firmly in the context of everyday life.The real novelty of this extraordinary painting lies in its systematic application of the laws of perspective. Jan Van Eyck and Rogier Van der Weyden had already used perspective, but only in interior scenes that were much simpler than this Last Supper. They had done nothing as complex or as perfect as the architecture of this central room. Moreover, the space is not entirely enclosed, for the outside world is visible at two points: once through the windows to the left, through which distant houses are visible, and again through the arch at the back of the room. This latter opening gives onto an enclosed garden painted in blue and pink tones, as if space were stretching out across it towards an invisible horizon. The t<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>zoid of the white table cloth, the distribution of the figures around it and their convergence on the central figure of Christ, as well as the subtle rhythm of the different colours, all conspire to endow this complex composition with a profound pictorial unity.\n",

      "This statue has been intended for the new Valois Chapel (destroyed) at Saint-Denis. As was usual with Pilon, before working the marble of the Virgin he produced a terracotta maquette (MusÃ©e du Louvre, Paris), which still retains traces of polychromy. With its swirling cascades of d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ry, it is a profound expression of Pilon's devout Catholicism at a time of religious disturbance in France. The statue has sometimes been seen as deriving its formal qualities from Burgundian sculpture of the 15th century, but in fact its agitated d<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries call to mind Italian sculpture in the generation after Michelangelo. The slender, nervous hands recall the style of Primaticcio, and the pyramidal silhouette evokes <a href=\"/html/m/michelan/1sculptu/pieta/1pieta0.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html/m/michelan/1sculptu/pieta/1pieta0.html')\">Michelangelo's Pietà,</a> a cast of which was brought from Italy by Primaticcio and placed in the chapel of the château of Fontainebleau.The Virgin of Sorrows, along with Pilon's deeply moving marble statue of St Francis in Ecstasy (1580; Paris, St Jean-St Francois), was a key work in the art of the Counter-Reformation in France, and both anticipate the emotion and studied affectation of Baroque art.\n",

      "Probably painted for the Colegio de Doña Maria, Madrid. It is of the same size and shape as the Pentecost, to which it was almost certainly a pair. The place of these two paintings in the chapel is more difficult to decide. The Resurrection was almost certainly on the left and the Pentecost on the right, because of their relationship in meaning with the Nativity and the Baptism, respectively. If they were placed above these two paintings, the narrower format would correspond with the upper range of paintings. This and the Pentecost would have been the last of the paintings executed for the Colegio.Only one other painting of the subject by El Greco is known, that for Santo Domingo el Antiguo. This painting and the Adoration of the Shepherds are higher in proportion to their width than the corresponding paintings in Santo Domingo el Antiguo.Christ is shown in a blaze of glory, striding through the air and holding the white banner of victory over death. The soldiers who had been placed at the tomb to guard it scatter convulsively. Two of them cover their eyes, shielding themselves from the radiance, and two others raise one hand in a gesture of acknowledgement of the supernatural importance of the event. Another wearing a helmet decorated with brilliantly coloured plumes, rests his cheek on his hand - the traditional pose of melancholy - still unaware of Christ's resurrection. El Greco's skill in creating dramatically foreshortened figures is clamorously apparent in the soldier wearing a yellow cuirass sprawled in the foreground and in the adjacent soldier in green. By excluding any visual reference to the tomb or to landscape, El Greco removed the scene from the realm of history, he articulated its universal significance through the dynamism of nine figures that make up the composition and the intensity of the light and colours.Again El Greco has created one of the greatest interpretations of the subject in art. It can, perhaps, only be compared with the great masterpiece by Piero della Francesca. Light is the important element in this image of the Risen Christ, as it was in the Adoration of the Shepherds, but of a different quality. The movement has an incomparably greater force than in the Santo Domingo painting and has nothing of the sharp explosive quality of the earlier work. The movement is not dissipated, but is contained and concentrated. The figures now are vehicles of movement and light. It is interesting to compare the treatment of the classical 'd<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>ries' of the soldier at the base of the composition with those of the saintly warriors of the Martyrdom of Saint Maurice and his Legions.\n"

The artist successfully juggled the formal elements of portraiture current among his innovative contemporaries working in northern Italy, such as the beautifully described pa<font color=\"ff0000\">rape</font>t, with its illusionistic cartellino, the forceful projection of the figure against the dark, neutral background, and the volumetric three-quarter view.There is a black chalk drawing in Vienna, directly related to this portrait.

However, the drawing is generally believed to be by Bonsignori himself.\n"
