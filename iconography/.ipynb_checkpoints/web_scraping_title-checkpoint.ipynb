The items lined up side by side in doctrinal fashion are presented in relation to death. At the same time, Stoskopff's painting seems to question the declaration on the slate by lending permanence and status to what is fleeting. It is precisely the reference to their transience that heightens our aesthetic pleasure in these illusory examples of worldly values, no more real than the theatrical props in a harleqinade - as referenced by the commedia dell'arte character of Zani, who winks at us from out of the picture.\n",

      "The arrangement of various dessert to form a spiritual scenery, commented in detail in connection with Still-Life with Bread and Confectionary (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt), can also be found in other still-lifes by Flegel. His small-format Dessert Still-Life is dominated by the contrast between a parrot and a mouse, representing the principles of good and evil, respectively.The mouse is nibbling at the sweets and has already opened a walnut, which, according to St Augustine, is a symbol of Christ, the shell pointing to the wooden cross and the sweet fruit to Christ's divinity. Confectionery made of crystallized sugar, nuts, figs and raisins, some in a costly Chinese bowl and some outside it, represent spiritual principles which are being guarded, as it were, by the green-feathered parrot sitting on the far edge of the bowl. The religious context is further emphasized by the grapes and the wine glass, and indeed by the carnation. From the late Middle Ages onwards theologians saw carnations as a symbol of Christ's death on the cross, because of the nail-shaped form of petals and fruit. Furthermore, the coins at the front are probably another reference to the Passion, reminding us of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.\n",

      "Fish still-lifes developed as a category during the seventeenth century - not an astonishing phenomenon when we recall that fishing, particularly for herring and cod, was a mainstay of the Dutch economy. A notable exponent of the type is Abraham van Beyeren. As the Dutch love for flowers, their love for seafood is proverbial. The Haarlemer Joseph de Bray, son of Salomon and brother of Jan, celebrated this taste in his picture, dated 1656, dedicated to the apotheosis of the pickled herring.Resting behind the large, succulent herring and other objects in the painting's foreground, there is an elaborate tablet, draped with a festoon of herrings and requisite onions, inscribed with a poem by the Remonstrant preacher and poet Jacob Westerbaen: 'In praise of the Pickled Herring' published in 1633. After telling of the herring's delight to the eye, palette, and its other qualities, Westerbaen adds that consumption of it 'Will make you apt to piss/And you will not fail/(With pardon) to shit/And ceaselessly fart...' - proof, if it is needed, that plain profane messages are as likely embodied in Dutch paintings as spiritual ones. The painting was evidently a success. In the following year he painted another, somewhat larger still-life, now in Aachen, dedicated to the same subject. It includes the text of Westerbaen's verse dedicated to the pickled herring, and a brief passage from his poem 'Cupido' on the page of an open folio accompanied by an ample display of herrings and onions.\n",

      "The artist belonged to the second generation of the famous dynasty of still-life painters. He spent his youth in Leiden and as demonstrated by this work, he established close connection with the Leiden school of painting.This splendid painting invokes the memory of the golden age of Dutch still-life painting. The sumptuousness of the instruments is especially fascinating. Most prominent among them is the six-stringed, inlaid viola da gamba leaning against the chair, with a lion's head for decoration and an \"S\" shaped sound hole (more characteristic of violin). Next to it on the ground are two types of lutes, a trumpet, a flute and a mandolin; in a chair on the left, a violin, a bagpipe and a small pocket violin.On the table, richly laid with fruits and golden objects, are the traditional symbols of Vanitas. To illustrate the transitoriness of pleasures gained from wealth, plentitude and eating and drinking, there is an up-ended wine jug from which its content have spilled onto the ground, symbolizing that earthly pleasure is short-lived and man will return to dust. In this context the instruments are symbols of physical love. Next to them the painter depicted a snail on the ground. It was generally believed that this animal was born of mud, thus it became the symbol of sin. In contrast, the ivy crawling up the wall in the background promises immortality. The peach, melon and fig, since they are cut open and their seeds are revealed, symbolize reviviscence and resurrection. This image make the message of the painting less somber, although its warning intent is unmistakably recognizable.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/18_cent/vivaldi_mandolin_concerto.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in G major for two mandolins and orchestra, RV 532</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n"

He specialized in flower pieces of the most elaborate design, although in the early part of his career he produced more conventional still-life paintings, such as the one in the MusÃ©e Fabre at Montpellier.The painting was executed in 1665 and submitted to the Academy at the time of the painter's admission in the same year.

In the foreground a viper aims its forked tongue at the leaves of a cabbage and, on a higher shelf, beside a ceramic vase, a mouse gnaws at a nut.At the lower right, in large capital letters, is a signature which has created a small scholarly controversy. It would appear that Tommaso Salini painted this still-life in 1621, but technical analysis has revealed that the inscription and date are not original and may have been added in the nineteenth century. The sole document relating to Salini is his last will and testament of 12 September 1625 and the posthumous inventory of his property drawn up between 14 and 16 September. The summary descriptions in the inventory were endorsed by the flower painter par excellence, Mario Nuzzi, called Mario de' Fiori, who was the pupil and nephew of Salini as well as his heir. The lists drawn up in his presence make no mention of paintings similar to this still-life. With these invaluable documents to hand, the name 'Salini' must be looked at in a new light. It has been suggested that he was a flower painter and the teacher of Nuzzi. This would mean that Salini was neither the author of this painting nor the others like it which have been attributed to him.\n",

      "A dozen bodegones (still lifes) and a painting of birds are recorded in the inventory of Goya's possessions made in 1812 after the death of his wife, and according to his French biographer, Matheron, he painted several still lifes in the market at Bordeaux during his last years there. The present example bears traces of the inventory mark that identifies the earlier group, and is remarkable for the period because of the casual arrangement of the sheep's head with its expressive eye, and sides of mutton. The signature is painted in red as if to simulate blood. For stylistic reasons this and other still lifes of the group - pictures of meat, fish, fowl and game - cannot be much earlier than the date they are recorded in Goya's house. This means that they must have been painted about the time of the 'ano del hambre', the year of the terrible famine in Madrid in 1811-12, when thousands died of hunger, thus raising the question of whether any allusion to the famine was intended by Goya. Were they perhaps meant as a sardonic commentary on the situation in one of the many illustrations of the effects of famine in his Desastres de la Guerra? A well-dressed woman stands before a group of starving victims, some dying, some dead, with the caption: 'The worst is to beg'.\n",

A long, dried-out lemon peel has been laid over the shell, linking the nautilus cup with the silver beaker in front of it, in whose engraved silver surface the peel is reflected. This beaker, with its simple decoration, forms in its turn the background for another precious object: the glass-holder, in which a 'berkemeyer' (a glass with a thick, hollow stem and a wide, conical bowl) has been clamped.The splendour of this still-life lies not only in its perfect arrangement within the diagonal composition, but also in the painstakingly chosen gradations of colour which run along the same diagonal. The yellow of the lemon peel is followed by the softer yellow of the glass-holder and the orange of the peach; the red lobster closes off the composition.\n",

A strong light enters the composition from the left, illuminating the spherical shapes of the pumpkin and the jug, albeit leaving the latter and part of the fruit in darkness.\n"

      "The attribution of this still-life to Caravaggio is doubtful.From a thematic point of view, large scale still-lifes in the Galleria Borghese are similar to outstanding early works by Caravaggio, but they lack the brilliance and the concentration on individual objects. This painting and another are usually attributed to Caravaggio. Because it is rather unconvincing to attribute such work to Caravaggio, some scholars distinguish this Caravaggesque painter of still-lifes from the master by naming him - after a splendid example of the genre - the Painter of the Still-Life in the Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/schubert/schubert_d431_blumen.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

      "In addition to fruit and flower still-lifes with cool colour harmonies, van Aelst also enjoyed painting elegant hunting weapons and dead animals placed in a dark corner by a wall for rich clients. One example is this still-life.A dead partridge is hanging by its leg from a piece of string. Its wings and feathers, which are grey with brownish patches, open up towards us at the bottom like a fan. The fly on the light-coloured feathers has an illusionist effect: disproportionately large in size, it belongs to the realistic level of the picture rather than its fictitious one, so that the viewer is given the impression that a real fly is crawling across the painting. The bird's head has been pressed slightly towards the middle by the blue hunting bag with the golden fringe and the adjustable shoulder strap which is lying on the stone shelf. Beside the partridge a hunting horn, also adorned with tassels, and a powder bottle have been hung up. The shiny, metallic grey of the hunting horn has been painted by the artist with a highly sensitive eye for the different hues of the bird's fluffy, grey feathers on its breast and as a contrast to the grey of the wings which merges into white towards the middle.But, although the bird has been rendered with almost unsurpassable precision, it has an odd abstract quality. It seems as if, in its material consistency, it had undergone a synthesis with the implement of civilization by which it was pursued - as if it was no longer merely part of nature and a victim, but an aesthetically refined and ennobled form of existence.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/18_cent/vivaldi_rv362_hunt.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in B flat major RV 362 op. 8 No. 10 (Hunt)</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n"

This painting shows a large number of thin, Venetian-style glasses in a wicker basket. Surrounded by other glass, clay and china vessels the basket, which is parallel to the edge of the painting, has been placed on a brilliantly white tablecloth that hangs down over the edge and forms a sharp contrast to the dark background.

For the young painter, the Dutch influence proved decisive on several account: it can be detected in his still-lifes with flowers and fruits in the use of colours, while the genre-like composition of his paintings depicting birds reveals the assimilation of Melchior de Hondecoeter's paintings of animals. Elegant parks with beautiful birds are the sites of BogdÃ¡ny's high society genre scenes. The exquisite components, such as fountains or antique ruins, enhance the grace and refinement of the composition. The painter obeyed the taste of his commissioners and made their paintings to fit into their surroundings. BogdÃ¡ny, who moved to England in 1688 and worked for the royal family and for the members of the English aristocracy, died as an esteemed artist.He studied the main attractions of his compositions, the exotic birds from the colonies, in the then very fashionable birds' houses; their precise depiction can also be seen in the painting \"Still-life with Birds\" from the 1710s. BogdÃ¡ny's paintings are still kept in their original surrounding, in English mansions and in the summer resorts of the Royal Family.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 14 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/20_cent/respighi_birds.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Ottorino Respighi: Birds, suite</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

      "Exceptionally for a still-life specialist, the Rotterdam-born Kalf was praised by an Amsterdam poet as one of the city's leading painters. Perhaps the praise would not have been forthcoming had he persevered in his first interest: shabby peasant barn interiors and still-lifes of humble kitchen implements, painted during his stay in Paris from about 1640 to 1646. After his arrival in Amsterdam, however, following his marriage to a cultivated young woman of good family, Kalf began to paint the type of still-life for which he is best known.Called in Dutch pronkstilleven ('still-lifes of display or ostentation'), these compositions, influenced by Flemish antecedents, feature luxury manufactured goods - silverware, Chinese porcelain, Oriental carpets, fragile glass - and exotic foodstuffs. They do not seem to have specific symbolic meaning but must have spoken to contemporary viewers of the wealth of the Dutch Republic, the might of its sea power and the efficiency of its distribution systems - for all this is implied in the eastern table carpet and in the fresh Italian lemon unwinding its peel in the foreground.The buffalo-horn in a silver mount belonged to the Saint Sebastian Archers' Guild, part of the city's civic guard. Dated 1565, this beautiful example of the silversmith's art, now in the Historisch Museum in Amsterdam, also testifies to the old Netherlandish tradition of municipal freedom, and the will of Dutch burghers to defend it. Kalf was to paint it more than once; it also appears in pictures by other artists.Ultimately, however, none of these associations is responsible for the grave monumental beauty of Kalf's painting. As in all his mature works, only a few objects are displayed and soberly arranged, in contrast with the luxuriant profusion of Flemish still-lifes. Against a dark background, succulent paint, broadly applied, models large forms and captures the very feel of surface textures. Strong accents of the richest and brightest colours surge to the surface - the huge scarlet lobster, the clear yellow and white lemon, touched with pink where it reflects the lobster. And it is the play of reflections and tinted shadows of these powerful hues which, like a musical motif, draws the composition together.\n",

But in 1884-85 he encountered a new theory of colour in the books and articles he was reading about the French painter Delacroix. From these texts van Gogh derived the thesis that one of the distinguishing features and great discoveries of recent art that made it 'modern' was the use of complementary and contrasting colours in place of tonality and chiaroscuro. The basic message of his reading was that each primary colour - red, blue, yellow - has a complementary colour composed of a mixture of the other two. The complement of red is green; of blue, orange; of yellow, violet. Shadows cast by an object should include the complementary colour of the object. Complementaries are also used to heighten and intensify the brilliance of colour. In his ambition to be modern van Gogh adopted these theories, but without a sophisticated understanding of them or a sound technical foundation as a painter. He applied them crudely and programmatically, though often with unexpectedly powerful and original effects.During the spring and summer of 1888 van Gogh corresponded regularly with Ãmile Bernard, giving his friend reports on work in progress and describing his colour experiments such as this still-life. The complementary pairs of blue and orange, yellow and violet can be easily recognized in this painting, and from the colour notes added to a sketch of it included in a letter to Bernard it is clear that the red-green pair was also employed.\n"

      "In 1888, Gauguin returned to France from Martinique. He stayed a second time at Pont-Aven, where a new and decisive meeting with Ãmile Bernard brought forward a new doctrine about painting. He broke away from Impressionism and applied the cloisonnism which he developed together with Bernard. The attempt at a contrived 'primitive' quality which Gauguin developed in Brittany, is particularly marked in this painting. The cloisonne effect of The Vision of the Sermon is developed, so that objects are outlined and strangely isolated against the backdrop of the tablecloth. The influence of Japanese art is particularly evident, and the composition may have been based on a print by Kuniyoshi. Added to the high viewpoint, and with the suppression of any tonal modelling, the two-dimensional surface of the picture space is exploited. In addition, the self-conscious naivety of the subject is enhanced by the grouping of objects into threes.\n",

These symbols of secular and ecclesiastical power at the zenith of the composition are further explained by a richly decorated bowl, worked by a goldsmith. It shows mythological scenes of unhappy love relationships, partly covering those 'vanitates' which are of lower order - a tambourine, lute, sabre, coat of mail and painter's palette, to name but a few. The statue of a mourning female figure in one of the niches bears great resemblance to the woman whose contours can be seen in Nicolas Poussin's famous self-portrait  at the Louvre. She can be regarded as a late successor to the weeping women who surround the altar tomb of Philip the Bold in Dijon.Pieter Boel's painting contains all the features normally associated with baroque solemnity, i.e. pomp and splendour even where power and wealth have become subject to the darkness of death. However, although all earthly possessions and authority are marked as vain, the dialectic of the painting never leaves any doubt that their real substance remains undisputed in this world and that the earthly order is preserved intact.\n",

He also painted many still-lifes, which, however, reflect the same qualities of asceticism, quiet contemplation and introversion for his choice of objects indicates the transience of human life.ZurbarÃ¡n does not do so by presenting a clock, a skull or an hourglass. Instead, on a brilliantly polished table, he shows us a pewter plate with lemons, a basket of oranges complete with leaves and blossoms, and a fine china cup on a silver saucer on which lies a rose in full bloom. Though lemons signify wealth in a Netherlandish still life, they have a very different meaning here, in the country where they actually grow. Even so, they are not represented as the fruits of daily life, but presented with all the solemn celebration of an offering on an altar.As in the paintings of his contemporary SÃ¡nchez CotÃ¡n, ZurbarÃ¡n isolates the individual objects from one another - even the composition appears to be a conscious though not excessively artificial arrangement. Against the dark background, the objects are completely static, and appear to be torn out of the context of everyday life. The human beings to whom they apparently belong have no place here.\n"

The objects depicted have both an allegorical and a more personal significance. The lighted candle, used in the painting of Gauguin's chair, derives from the emblematic tradition of still-life and signifies light and life; its opposite, the snuffed-out candle, was used in memento mori still-life and van Gogh had included it in a still-life with books which he painted after his father's death in 1885 (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh). The optimistic note sounded by the candle flame is underlined by the presence of the sprouting onions, taken from his Yellow Chair (a 'self-portrait'). On the other hand, van Gogh has added his pipe and tobacco and an empty bottle, possibly once containing absinthe, all of which endangered his health.Modern research has intriguingly shown that absinthe itself can cause epileptic fits. Van Gogh had consumed this poisonous beverage in some quantity during the months in Arles, and many of his subsequent fits coincide with occasions on which he had access to it. The drawing board on which most of these objects are placed indicates van Gogh's resumption of work. He informed his brother that he was painting still-lifes to ease himself back into painting after his hospitalization. However, the colours used in this painting are more tempered and less intense, more controlled and less arbitrary than those he had been using both in the summer of 1888 and under the aegis of Gauguin in the autumn preceding his attack.\n",

At times this pattern was of course broken, especially when Heda had to depict the valuable crockery of distinguished households, such as columbine goblets, cups of welcome, etc. Heda then went back either to his triangular or his pyramid-shaped compositions. But it is noticeable that whenever he did this, he also increased the incidence of 'chaotic' elements, showing, for example, the white table-cloth extremely crumpled as well as an overturned jug. (The overturning of goblets goes back to an ancient custom, and in the 16th and 17th centuries goldsmiths, for example, fashioned special goblets that had to be emptied all at once so that they could be placed on the table upside down.)\n",

Textures of fur and feathers are richly worked in the oil paint, and while the illusion is brilliant from a certain distance, a closer look reveals that he paint takes on a life of its own.\n",

Valuable and rare objects, such as the silver-gilt cup and the blue and white porcelain bowls, often feature in works of this kind, and provided artists with the opportunity to demonstrate their technical mastery in rendering a wide range of textures and materials and the play of light across their varied surfaces. Such magnificent displays were generally set before a dark background, which only served to intensify the theatricality of their presentation.\n",

This stylistic evolution of the still-life, which in the North is linked particularly with the names of the Haarlem painters Pieter Claesz. and Willem Heda, found its most prominent representative in the South in the person of Cornelis Mahu.In the 1630s Mahu followed the Haarlem painters closely, and some of his paintings are direct, if somewhat stiff, copies of Heda.The present still-life shows on a table a plate with a pate and nuts, a salt barrel, a folded pot, a Roemer and a beer glass.

      "Judged the most talented student in the Spanish Royal Academy in 1745, MelÃ©ndez was expelled in 1748 as a result of a public dispute between the Academy and his father, also a painter. The expulsion prevented the artist from receiving commissions for altarpieces or large narrative pictures. In the last twenty years of his life he executed a hundred or so still lifes, for which he has now become famous. Although nearly half were first recorded in the Spanish royal residence at Aranjuez, they may not have been commissioned by the king directly from the painter, who died in poverty.This picture is one of a group of the artist's largest and finest works, perhaps made in connection with his second petition to the king to become court painter. Like most of MelÃ©ndez's still lifes, it focuses attention simultaneously on the geometrical forms of the homely and characteristically Spanish objects depicted - oranges, walnuts, a melon, wooden sweet boxes and barrel, terracotta jugs - and on their surface texture, and both shape and texture are revealed through the strong light falling from the upper left of the painting. The colours are restricted to black, white and a range of earth tones, relieved only by the brilliant orange. The spectator's viewpoint, so close to the picture surface, is located just above the smaller of the two jugs. Only the cracked walnuts allow us a glimpse of their edible flesh, among the unpeeled fruit and the sealed containers of sweetmeats, olives and oil, tantalisingly displayed humble products of Spanish soil and industry, ennobled by the artist's brush.\n",

      "Like the apple in the works of Baschenis and CÃ©zanne, the melon - in numerous varieties - is a leitmotif that \"rolls\" through MelÃ©ndez's still-lifes. One of the painter's most sophisticated compositions is Still-Life with Cantaloup Melon, in which he proves himself a fanatic when it comes to rounded forms. He devotes himself to natural produce and man-made items with equal enthusiasm, piling them one behind or on top of the other and thereby filling the pictorial space. Plates, a white cloth, bread and a knife rise above the top of the woven basket into which they have been packed. The objects are painted in close-up and brought right to the front edge of the table, so that the melon curves forward into the space occupied by the viewer. The different surfaces are perfectly imitated and the painting of the melon skin, with its strikingly reticular texture, is astounding. Some objects reflect the light while others absorb it; light assumes the function of a sculptural material. A sense of spirited dynamism arises out of the alternate enlargement and reduction in scale of the pictorial objects.\n",

Set against a dark background without clear spatial delimitations, we can see pedestals and stone plinths building up from the ground. These are covered with an abundance of fruit and vegetables, with delicate stalks of grain winding themselves around pumpkins and corn cobs with blue and yellow kernels. Together with peaches, plums and grapes they combine to form an arrangement which has an affinity to de Heem's religious fruit still-lifes.This painting, too, includes an encoded Christian message. Because of its many seeds and its rapid growth, the pumpkin had been interpreted as a symbol of growing Christian faith since the early Middle Ages. Similar ideas were probably associated - as far as can be determined - with corn cobs and its many kernels, though corn is not mentioned in the Bible. Grapes and corns are well-known references to the Eucharist again. In Mignon's painting the artist arranged the fruit in such a way that it is framed vertically by branches growing upwards from the ground. These branches, which are probably intended to indicate an oak tree, are completely covered with moss and seem almost dried up, though some shoots can be identified which indicate the tree's ability to survive.\n",

      "Among the Dutch still-life painters Otto Marseus van Schrieck has a special position. His somewhat exotic oeuvre has only come to be appreciated in more recent decades. He nearly always presents a small section of the woods with thick dark undergrowth, and a hidden microcosm in which frogs, toads, snakes and lizards crowd together, fighting for their lives. Marseus van Schrieck knew the habits of these animals very well and is known to have bred reptiles and snakes himself. This painting also shows bizarre botanical species, such as a coral fungus on the left and thistles, under which a lizard - a so-called lacerta - is hiding, about to attack the toad.Marseus van Schrieck has designed an idealized habitat, modelled on biological dioramas, which are illustrations with a three-dimensional effect. However, although the world of his paintings reflects the zoological and botanical interests of a well-versed science amateur, it is still not free from religious associations. Indeed, it is the religious meaning which determines the selection and composition of the animals and plants. The snake, the toad and the lizard are the 'unclean animals', the serpent had negative connotations and was regarded as an incarnation of evil, and such, was a favourite subject for depicting evil.\n",

      "Luis Egidio MelÃ©ndez is the most important Spanish still-life painter of the 18th century. He saw his bodegones as part of an ambitious project. In a petition addressed to King Charles III in 1772, he wrote that he was planning a series of paintings for a cabinet that would illustrate all the different foodstuffs produced by the Spanish climate over the four seasons in the four elements. Up to this point he had only finished those showing the fruits of the earth. He had the means neither to continue the project, however, nor indeed to feed himself.It seems somewhat unlikely that MelÃ©ndez planned his still-lifes as a coherent programme right from the outset; rather, he must have arrived at this idea as time went by and he found himself in possession of a sizeable stock of unsold pictures of food and household utensils. During these years he supplied 44 still-lifes to Prince Carlos of Asturia, the later King Charles IV. The paintings went first to the newly built Casita del PrÃ­ncipe, a country villa near the Escorial de Abajo. Around 1800 they hung in the dining room in the royal palace in Aranjuez.\n"

      "Unlike that of most 17th and 18th century female artists, Rachel Ruysch's work has never sunk into obscurity. She also enjoyed public recognition of her talent during her lifetime: in 1701, three years before painting this particularly charming bouquet, she was the first woman to be admitted to the Confrerie Pictura in The Hague, and in 1708 Johann Wilhelm, the Elector of the Palatinate, appointed her to the position of court painter. The artist's specialities were compositions with fruit, flowers and woodlands. Within this genre she was never a real innovator, but she perfectly assimilated the work of others, equalling them in terms of her painting technique. At least for certain partial aspects of flower painting she sought her own solutions, thereby imposing her own stamp on her creations. During the final decade of the 17th century we can observe the influence in particular of her teacher, Willem van Aelst, and that of Simon Pietersz. Verelst. From the beginning of the 18th century she was inspired by Jan Davidsz. de Heem and Abraham Mignon.The use of a dark background for a bouquet is a tried and tested way of bringing colours and shapes to their own. The fact that very few flowers in the bouquet cross also shows that the painter wished to present the various species in a way that made them clearly recognisable. This almost scientific trait is certainly due, in Ruysch's case, to her father's position as a professor of botany. Typical for this period is the adding of insects and fruit of every kind, here a branch of plums. This fruit with its characteristic matt, bluish tint, which is so difficult to reproduce, appears to have been chosen by painters precisely in order to demonstrate their technical skill. One striking feature of this sumptuous bouquet is the S-shapes in the composition, with which Ruysch seeks a more natural-looking structure in contrast to the strong diagonals found in her earlier work. Rachel Ruysch's personality also speaks to our imagination: although building a professional career was something unusual for a woman at that time, she was simultaneously a \"normal\" woman of her time, as she bore ten children.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/schubert/schubert_d431_blumen.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

      "Jan van der Heyden was one of the leading architectural painters of his generation and a man of more parts than most Dutch painters. When he was a boy of thirteen his parents settled in Amsterdam; apart from trips to the Rhineland, the northern, and the southern Netherlands he spent his life there. He painted some imaginary cityscapes based on studies done in Germany, which at first blush appear to be true-to-life views, and lovely capriccios which show expert knowledge of the principles of classical architecture. His oeuvre also includes about forty landscapes that reveal a debt to Adriaen van de Velde, who is credited with painting figures in some of his pictures, and a few intriguing still-lifes that can be justifiably categorized as interiors. Van der Heyden is best known for his views of Amsterdam.Most of van der Heyden's paintings were done in the sixties and seventies - his work as inventor, entrepreneur, and city official probably slacked his pace. But he continued to paint until the very end. His latest firmly datable picture, Still-life with Rarities, now in Budapest, shows the corner of a 'Kunstkamer' in strong even light with meticulous depictions of rarities from the natural and man-made world, but not the collector who assembled them. It is proudly inscribed with his monogram and states he painted it when he was seventy-five years old; he attained that age in 1712, the year he died.Among the objects displayed in the Kunstkamer, which is most probably a fictive one, are a hanging armour of an armadillo, a copy after an etching of Pietro Testa's Suicide of Dido above the marble mantle, an inlaid cabinet used for housing treasured coins and natural specimens, oriental weapons, and on the bright red Chinese embroidered cloth that covers the table globes, one terrestrial and the other celestial, and an open Blaeu atlas. Next to the table there is a red damask covered chair that supports a folio Bible open at the favourite passage of Dutch moralists: Ecclesiastes, Chapter I, which begins with 'The words of the Preacher . . . vanity of vanities; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?' The biblical reference to transience is reinforced by Testa's Suicide of Dido, a subject taken from Virgil's Aeneid which can be read as an exemplum of love's ephemeral nature.Van der Heyden's message is obvious and familiar. It is one we have heard from other still-life specialists: preparation for salvation is of greater importance than all the treasures, pleasures, and knowledge that can be derived from this world.\n",

The size and scale of these recall the monumental paintings of sunflowers of the summer of 1888, but the disciplined use of complementary colours also establishes a link with the experiments in colour and in flower painting which absorbed him in his first year in Paris, 1886. In Saint-RÃ©my he painted pink roses against a green ground, and here, violet irises against a yellow field. The painting betrays a renewed liveliness and intensity of colour. Instead of toning down the contrasts in order to harmonize the different parts of the painting, as he sometimes did, van Gogh has tried here, as he had done in Paris, to sharpen and heighten them. Van Gogh has painted these flowers on what was his preferred size of canvas in late 1888-90. The regular use of the same size of canvas meant that if and when his paintings were exhibited they would work together as a series.\n"

His fruitful career was linked in close symbiosis with the artistic world of Rubens, with whom he frequently collaborated. Both the paintings Snyders made alone and those he produced in collaboration with Rubens are so intimately bound up with Rubens' ideas and language of form that they have to be appreciated in this context. Just as in Rubens' work, Snyders assembles the elements of his paintings not only on the basis of their artistic characteristics, but also as elements with a part to play in the overall design and decorative effect of the canvas as a whole. The luxuriant Still-Life is a representative example of Snyders' oeuvre.\n",

These forms occupy a stone niche with a slightly pointed arch, the keystone of which is inscribed HVMANA VANA (Human Vanity). The spandrels flanking the arch are filled with sculptural figures of philosophers with books at their feet? to the left, Democritus, who gestures toward the globe and laughs; and, to the right, Heraclitus, who points to the sphere and weeps. The sphere purposefully resembles a soap bubble, the familiar vanitas motif. Two common vanitas symbols, cut flowers and smoke, rise from urns at either side of the niche. The coins depicted at the bottom of the composition on the sill between the vases were used as currency in the Netherlands about 1600. One of them, the <a href=\"/html_m/m/master/zunk_du/2/z_medal.html\" onclick=\"return OpenOther('/html_m/m/master/zunk_du/2/z_medal.html')\">silver medal of 1602</a> commemorates the capture of a Portuguese galleon by two Zeeland merchant ships earlier that year, off Saint Helena in the South Atlantic.Democritus (c. 460 - c. 370 B.C.) and Heraclitus (c. 540 - c. 475 B.C.) are known as the 'laughing and crying philosophers.'Democritus, a Greek philosopher, born at Abdera in Thrace, was known as the laughing philosopher because he found amusement in the folly of mankind. (The citizens of Abdera were proverbially stupid.) His philosophic system was contrasted with that of the earlier Heraclitus of Ephesus, who was known as the 'Dark' or 'Obscure' and was reputed to be melancholic. They were linked as a contrasting pair by Seneca, by Juvenal and others. Florentine humanists, to whom such classical texts were well-known used the pair to support the view that a cheerful demeanour was proper to a philosopher.The two philosophers are widely represented in European painting of the Renaissance and Baroque period, either in one picture or as companion pieces.

In Holland it developed parallel to so-called genre painting - scenes of daily life, landscapes and still-lifes - and was the domain of specialist painters such as Bosschaert.This painting depicts a bouquet, placed in a dark background, which consists of a columbine, tulips and a peony.\n",

The artist indulges in the play of forms, of alternating voids and solids, of vanishing perspectives that animate the composition; and books, open or closed, serve as a support for the violin and bow.\n"

      "Ribot painted this still life following the principles of the Realist movement led by Gustave Courbet. Realist artists endeavoured to render nature as they captured it, far from any form of idealisation. Ribot was inspired by the works of those 17th-century Spanish artists who had discovered the essence of Naturalism. In the mid-19th century there were numerous works of Spanish art in Paris, which had been taken to the French capital during the Spanish War of Independence. The creation of king Louis Philip's Spanish Gallery, which remained in the Louvre until 1848, also helped to increase this presence. Ribot was especially interested in Ribera's treatment of figures and objects and his dramatic use of chiaroscuro.\n",

      "CÃ©zanne developed a completely new way of depicting objects in space. He reinvented still-lifes on the basis of their two-dimensionality, and used purely artistic means to give them depth. He used dual viewpoint to show objects from two different viewpoints. He avoided linear perspective in his depictions of objects, he could paint them so that their size was in proportion o to their importance in the composition as a whole.CÃ©zanne set up all his still-lifes in his studio. Some of the objects he used are still in his last studio on the Chemin des Lauves in Aix. Apart from the fruit, many of the objects, such as jugs, pots and plates, frequently recur in his compositions. The pictures often include a dramatically billowing white tablecloth, giving the paintings a touch of Baroque extravagance.\n",

      "Barbari was the first Italian Renaissance artist of note to travel to the German and Netherlandish courts. He probably received training with Alvise Vivarini in Venice in the 1490s. His best-known painting is the Still Life with a Dead Partridge of 1504, a trompe l'oeil probably made for one of the palaces of the Saxon dukes.This Still-Life with Partridge, Gauntlet and Bolt of a Crossbow is the earliest independent still-life in the European painting. It is one of those paintings that mislead the unprepared viewer by displaying the wall on which these objects have been hung. It is likely that the painting was cleverly integrated into the room of a hunting lodge where it was intended to provide amusement to the hunting party. Nowadays we would hardly be deceived by such a painting technique. At the time, however, it was radically new and people's habits of perception had been formed by less illusionist paintings. Barbari's still-life is akin to extremely precise studies of nature by contemporary German artists such as DÃ¼rer and Lucas Cranach the Elder. It has therefore been suggested that the Italian artist was influenced by DÃ¼rer.\n",

      "This is a typical illustration of the type of still-life of which Kalf was an outstanding specialist. The still-lifes by Kalf look very different from those of his predecessors (like Pieter Claesz. and Willem Heda). They are, in a sense, much more theatrical; in their sonorous quality they bring to mind the landscapes of his contemporary, Jacob van Ruisdael.In the paintings by Heda or Pieter Claesz., the objects are ordered in a simple way; they are just laid out on the table. The light is even; shadows are used only to emphasize each object's plastic form. The still-life is generally set in a rather wide space (the painting itself being oblong). In Kalf's paintings, however, the space is narrowed. The backgrounds is much darker; and in this narrow space, against this background, the still-life seems curiously isolated. A soft light picks out each different object, showing its unique quality and colour, as spotlights focus on actors on a dark stage. In the narrow space, the arrangement too is much tighter.For this rich, glowing kind of still-life the 17th centuy used an apt term, \"pronkstilleven\" (still-life of ostentation); and part of the content of this term is certainly the choice of objects itself. In Heda and Claesz. food and utensils appear that belong to normal life: bread, beer, fish, plates and jugs of pewter or ordinary glass. Kalf (and his contemporary Abraham van Beyeren too) uses almost exclusively objects that are extraordinary: vessels of silver and gold, chalices of china, lobster, tropical fruit, displayed against rich Persian cloth.\n",

Within a few decades, the tulips had become the most fashionable of flowers. Experimentation produced countless new varieties, and the expanding market, combined with speculation, led to widespread tulip mania.

      "Flegel, Germany's first purely still-life painter, is believed to have worked in the studio of the Flemish artist Lukas van Valckenborch as a painter of flowers, metalware and fruit, a fact that would certainly appear to be borne out by this painting.The very Netherlandish-looking bouquet of flowers with tulips, carnations, roses and narcissi, is as superbly painted as the silver vase ornamented with golden mascarons in which it has been placed. The different qualities of silver, gold and pewter, their various degrees of brilliance, hardness and finish have been rendered in painstaking detail. The heavy pewter plates are juxtaposed with an elegant, fine-rimmed silver dish and a golden-lidded chalice bearing a fine statuette of Mars. The blade of the knife at the edge of the table, the dish of hazelnuts, the lid and edge of the brown earthenware jug - all are variations on the artist's theme.The display of foodstuffs seems less impressive at first glance, and arranged almost at random. Everything seems to be arranged by pure chance, so much so in fact that an allegorical interpretation seems unlikely. Though the composition may appear purely cumulative, it is nevertheless precisely calculated, especially in the masterly distribution of colour highlights.\n",

      "Gabriel de la Corte was one of the principal flower painters working in Madrid during the second half of the 17th century. His technique is markedly different from that of his contemporary BartolomÃ© PÃ©rez and the older Juan de Arellano, for rather than adhering to the tradition of the great Flemish still-life painters in their precision of detail, his brushwork is at once more spirited and schematic..Unlike Juan de Arellano and BartolomÃ© PÃ©rez, De la Corte did not enjoy royal patronage at the court and as a result had to make a living selling his works in the shops of Madrid. According to Palomino he contributed the flower garlands to the work of artists such as Antonio CastrejÃ³n and MatÃ­as de Torres and a large body of his known oeuvre consists of floral and architectural decoration, probably painted to adorn the grand houses of Madrid (which out of context today perhaps no longer retain their original impact and effect).\n",

It shows the artist's unflagging attention to the forms of his subjects, which are geometrical and capricious at the same time. The instruments are studied under a light that reveals their inner poetry but leaves their age-old shape and substance intact. Lovingly selected, these mandolins and horns are seen in terms of a strict construction of shadowed tones, broken only occasionally by a lighter passage. Their arrangement suggests an illusory, unchanging fixity, as if a symphony had been transposed from sound into three-dimensional composition, after the music had stopped.The instruments represented are a clarinet, a mandolin, a double-bass bow and - on the crest - a recorder.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/18_cent/vivaldi_mandolin_concerto.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in G major for two mandolins and orchestra, RV 532</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

He also painted a number of elegant game pictures in a clear light. They show close views of dead prey - occasionally accompanied by killed poultry - that include scrupulously painted guns, hunting bags and horns, bells and other gear of the sport. As most trophy pieces they were designed as representative pictures of the sport, not records of the spoils of a specific hunt.In this picture the painter displayed the finely worked equipment of the huntsman on a marble ledge: a velvet hunting bag with chamois strap, trimmed with gold embroidery and fringes, and a tasseled horn. Above it he suspended the exquisite catch of a fat partridge and three small game birds. The exquisite blue of the velvet contains the expensive pigment lapis lazuli, which yields ultramarine colour when ground. It was imported from China. Van Aelst's lavish use of it reinforces the preciousness of the arrangement and confirms its destination in a wealthy home. Most Dutch painters used cheaper, less stable blue pigments.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/19_cent/weber_freischutz_chorus.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Carl Maria von Weber: Der FreischÃ¼tz, Act III: Jagerchor</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

Various animals and birds perch and scuttle around amongst the fruit.This work is an impressive display of opulence.

The piece is characterised by such dynamism that it almost contradicts the definition of \"still-life\": The blue and white porcelain dish is precariously tilted, the apple on the left almost falls from the table, a bird clings upside down from a slender vine branch. The sumptuousness of the arrangement is emphasised by the heavy blue curtain in the background, an attribute of courtly representation.The vivid colours also underline the feeling of opulence: The blue parrot presiding over the scene, the shiny red apples, the yellow lemon peel, the green birds.

      "Francisco Barrera became an important figure in the artistic community in Madrid during the 1630s and 1640s, when he took over leadership of the painters' guild. However, he remained a relatively undistinguished master in the panorama of painting at the Spanish court. Like many other painters of limited talents, Barrera was an all-rounder whose production centred on religious subjects, images of saints, landscapes and still-lifes. Like Juan de Arellano, Barrera worked for the open market and sold his paintings from a shop in the centre of Madrid. The rise in popularity of still-life and flower paintings among collectors in Madrid during the middle years of the century doubtlessly encouraged Barrera to turn to this genre. Although his religious paintings are unknown today, his still-life paintings show that he developed a distinct personality in paintings of this type.This painting represents lilies and carnations in an oriental-style vase, the freshness of the lilies denoted by the fact that only five of the blooms have opened. Alongside these, there is a plate of cherries and apricots, that are kept cool by pieces of snow from the wine cooler. The representation on the vase of a monkey picking fruit whimsically relates this object to the fruit collected in the bowl in the picture. A jug of water is placed in the background and in the foreground a pie rests on a napkin, with a knife.The painting typifies Barrera's style in still-life and flower painting. He has sharply defined the forms and details of the flowers, and a certain hardness in their facture reflects the influence of the flower paintings of Juan van der Hamen and Antonio Ponce, the latter working with Barrera on decorative painting projects at the Buen Retiro in the 1630s.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/schubert/schubert_d431_blumen.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

As a rule his work is fresh and perfectly conveys what he is depicting, so that you can be almost certain the only thing missing among his beautiful flowers is the scent, which they appear to give off. He is a great master, a favourite of the Muses, who paints everything from nature.

      "In the late summer of 1885 Gauguin travelled to London on business and this painting may have been produced during that trip. The work is quite unique in his oeuvre, and seems to represent a self conscious attempt at fusing the ingredients of different cultures, worked in an avant-garde style. The horse's head is borrowed from the Elgin Marbles, on display in the British MÃ¼seum, and coupled with Japanese fans and a puppet of the type that were popular in Paris at the time. Such plunderings from non-Western sources was later to become commonplace in Gauguin's work, when he used them deliberately to attempt to create a 'primitive' flavour. However, it is the handling of the work that makes it unique, for the loose brushwork of earlier Impressionist style paintings has been systematized into the pointillist technique used by Seurat and Signac at this time. Gauguin has rejected the methods of the Impressionists and attempted to paint in the manner of the most advanced Parisian artists.\n",

      "The painting depicts a 'pronk' still-life of grapes, cherries, walnuts and a peeled lemon, with oysters on a pewter plate, and a glass roemer, wine glass and gilt goblet, all on a draped table.'Pronkstilleven' is a type of still-life painting. It is a term that could be translated as 'ostentatious still-life'. These still-lifes displayed an array of luxurious possessions that reflected the lifestyle of the wealthy in seventeenth century Holland. Venetian glass, Chinese porcelain and Turkish carpets bedecked with ornamental gold and silverware were painted as status symbols, to be hung in the homes of the affluent patrons who commissioned them. However the choice of objects was not always for spectacle alone as they sometimes carried a symbolic significance. Although only the rich could afford such rare artefacts, which were usually imported from distant lands, their inclusion in a painting could be interpreted as a patriotic tribute to the prosperity of Dutch trade. The inclusion of citrus fruits alongside wine is often read as encouraging moderation in the use of alcohol, as lemon juice was added to wine to reduce its potency and for medicinal effect.The painting is signed lower left: J. van.

Although this is a so-called breakfast still-life (an onbijtje), hardly any food is shown, but only the sparse left-overs of a meal, such as the olive on the plate, where it forms some kind of optical barrier between the hollow foot of the goblet and the plate that reflects it. Unlike the overabundance of food in earlier Flemish still-lifes, this painting emphasizes a refinement of taste. Naive consumerism has been replaced by aesthetic sublimation under the influence of Protestant introspection and asceticism.\n",

It seems likely that MelÃ©ndez's archaic miniaturist style and lack of experience beyond that specialised work counted against him, at a time when the royal court required artists adept in producing large-scale works in fresco and canvas (such as Corrado Giaquinto) to decorate the new Palacio Real, as well as proven portrait painters to promote the recent accesion of Charles III in 1759. On completion of his royal illuminations it appears that MelÃ©ndez received no further commissions at court and as a result the artist began to turn in desperation to the subject which ironically would earn him enduring international fame - still-life painting.It is no co-incidence therefore that the artist's earliest known still-lifes date from around 1759-60. Despite the important tradition of still-life painting during the Spanish Golden Age, the genre had dramatically declined by the second half of the 18th century, with none of the court painters being regular practicioners of the art. For MelÃ©ndez, still-lifes were a relatively easy commodity to sell, and would typically have been painted on speculation of finding a buyer (rather than on commission). It seems that during the 1760s and 1770s he largely cornered the market in Madrid, being the only significant still-life painter working there at that time.\n",

      "The most neglected area of French 17th-century painting is that of still-life. It is still sometimes mistakenly assumed that the work of still-life painters was insignificant in their time compared with the grand designs of Claude and Poussin but, with one major exception, all the main still-life painters worked in Paris; they were not provincial artists working in obscurity away from the mainstream of the development of painting.The exception was the obscure SÃ©bastian Stoskopff, whose oeuvre has only recently been reconstructed. He was isolated in Strasbourg, the main town of the province of Alsace, which did not come under French rule until 1648 (although Strasbourg itself was not occupied until 1681). In the Middle Ages the artistic traditions of Alsace had their own flavour, being subjected to influences from central Europe, Italy, and, to a lesser extent, France. Stoskopff, however, was influenced by none of these traditions, being a totally isolated painter working in a style verging on the naive. Influences from such German still-life painters as Georg Flegel are discernible, but they merely be caused by the similarity of subject-matter rather than by any stylistic affinity.Stoskopff art's is unique. One of the best examples of his work is the Still-Life of Glasses in a Basket. The tonality is monochrome, and the glasses in the basket are positioned in disarray. To this day, waitresses in restaurants in the region collect the empty drinking glasses by placing them heaped up in a basket rather than balancing them on a tray. There is therefore no complex iconography behind such a depiction; it is just a careful record of an everyday sight.\n",

      "When he published this painting at the end of the 1920s,  Roberto Longhi described it as an 'Unfinished meal - the carafe half-emptied, the melon and the water melon cut, the pear intact and the apple cut, and the flies jumping on their own shadows'. Longhi was at this time just beginning his research into Caravaggio and, in his view, the painting, which is impressive but really only of medium size, was by Caravaggio. Who else could have painted a masterpiece of such intensity and of such compositional excellence?Caravaggio's paternity in this case, however, was quite short-lived. By the 1950s the work had been attributed to an anonymous artist close to Carlo Saraceni named 'Pensionante del Saraceni'. Agreement on this attribution was almost unanimous, but it has not yet to a precise identification of the artist. His probable French nationality and his first-hand knowledge of Caravaggio appear to be the only secure information we have about him. The group of works attributed to him is tiny and the Washington painting is his only true still-life.In this still-life the table is covered with a silken cloth on which are placed a pear, a monumental slice of water melon, a melon, a plate of fruit and a glass carafe half full of white wine. Two flies buzz at a distance, but they could easily jump onto these recently abandoned leftovers. The dark background is one of the walls of a room, not just a backdrop as it is in the more or less contemporaneous painting in Rome attributed to the Master of the Hartford Still-life. In Pensionante's picture the few pieces of fruit and the splendid carafe reflecting the light possess an extraordinary presence. The soft, almost velvety light is unlike that in Caravaggio's youthful works. It dissolves the forms and multiplies the reflections in the shadows.\n",

      "This painting shows a wicker basket with tea towel, candle, ceramic cup, flask, fruit and peas. It exemplifies the simplicity and tactile naturalism that mark the expressive language of the Marchigian artist Magini, whose precedents can be identified in the sober compositions of the Master of Rodolfo Lodi and Cristoforo Munari. As can often be noted in his autograph works, here Magini used various elements typical of his iconographic repertory, taking them from the prepared cartoons he assembled differently for each work to create compositions varying in complexity.\n",
      "https://www.wga.hu/art/b/bascheni/stillins.jpg\n",
      "The art of Baschenis represents a peculiar chapter in the development of Italian still-life painting: through it the Bergamo School suddenly became famous, and since he had many followers and pupils, the genre of still-life painting with instruments became widely practiced. His large ceremonial compositions are his most characteristic and best works. The moderate and cheerful realism of his style was inspired by Caravaggio, but it remained free of the soul-searching dilemma encountered by the painters of seventeenth-century Rome, Naples and Florence. In his choice of themes and objects he was probably influenced by the world-famous instrument-making shop at nearby Cremona, which, for example, produced the beautiful lutes and violins of the Amati family.In Baschenis's paintings the instruments are the mediums of the Vanitas idea, and they are seldom coupled with the more expressive images of skulls, candles or books. In themselves a violin with its strings broken or a dusty lute are symbols of mortality. In this painting a single flower accentuates the meaning, and the presence of the globe makes it universally valid. Even the jewel-inlaid ebony writing desk is not merely decorative counterpoint in the red-gold-blue-green-brown harmony; rather it invokes the vanity of sciences as well. The two lutes laid down across each other and the violin rendered in side-view reveal the painter's excellent knowledge of the instruments' anatomy.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/16_cent/viadana_bergamasca.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Lodovico Viadana: La Bergamasca</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

      "Still-life became an extremely important and much-painted genre in 17th-century Holland, and numerous different ways of interpreting the subject developed, amongst them some with a moralizing intention and representing a reflection upon life and its pleasures. Heda was one of the best painters of still-lifes of serving tables and food, to which he gives a monumental feel and at the same time a certain compositional restraint, which suggests to us that we should apply a similar restraint towards our consumption of the food.Heda's style is characterized by its use of a monochromatic palette of green, grey and silvery tones. His compositions are balanced and never overcrowded, depicting a tabletop on which various items of food, objects and luxurious vessels are casually but carefully arranged. Pewter (a metal used for jugs and plates), silver and glass were the materials most painted by the artist.\n",

      "The best representative of the classical period of Dutch still-life painting is Willem Kalf. He was born in Rotterdam, where he was probably influenced by FranÃ§ois Rijckhals (after 1600-47), a Middelburg painter best known for his small peasant scenes which include displays of fruit and vegetables, and of impressive pronk still-lifes that include sumptuous gold and silver vessels. Kalf began by painting similar motifs: little pictures of kitchens and barns, as well as large still-lifes of metalwork, glass, and porcelain. As in the work of other pronk still-life painters, the same costly objects appear in his paintings more than once. Since he was a dealer in works of art as well as a painter he may have used objects in his stock as models.\n",

He achieved this effect by means of a more supple technique, by using less diverse and less exuberant colours, by letting some of the flowers to overlap and by the subtle play of light and shadow.

      "On the edge of a niche, half covered by a bronze-coloured velvet cloth with a fringed edge, a large number of objects are presented in a highly studied fashion in such a way as to maximise the volume, colour and texture of each individual item and to produce sensuous contrasts: a luxuriant still-life that is a feast for the eyes. The base of the composition is formed by a Wanli egg-shell china bowl with fruits. We can make out an orange, a half peeled lemon, apricots, white and purple grapes, medlars and plums. To the right a lobster, flanked by peaches and apricots on a raw wood box. To the left a simple round box serves as a base for a half filled rummer. The presence of an elegant fluted glass, providing the top of the composition, is indicated solely by the light reflected on the narrow top. A third, bowl-shaped glass stands - scarcely visible - between the fluted glass and the lobster. A small collection of flowers - roses, a carnation, violets - forms a colourful point of light and a visual counterweight to the dominating red lobster to the left of the bowl. The visual gaps are filled and a lighter accent is added with smaller fruit, creepers, twigs, blades and insects: we see blackberries, medlars, hazelnuts, acorns, cherries, a bumble bee, caterpillars, butterflies and a dragonfly.In the composition a number of ovals are enclosed in a triangle, which in turn is literally rounded off by the arch of the niche. A large diagonal traverses the whole ensemble, ending on the lower left on the lid of the reed basket. To the right of it, vine tendrils curl over the edge of a copper wine cooler.For more than a hundred years this work of art was catalogued as being by Jan Davidsz. de Heem. Despite the undoubted quality of the piece, sealed with the master's name on the top left corner, a detailed stylistic investigation and a closer analysis of the signature by De Heem expert Fred G. Meijer have cast justified doubt on the true author. Recently a canvas from the Joseph Verner Reed collection was designated by him as the prototype for this and other, already known variants. Who painted this version remains for the time being an intriguing question: we do not immediately know any figure in De Heem's immediate and wider circle to whom to attribute this painting exploit.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/19_cent/rimsky-korsakov_bumble_bee.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov: The Flight of the Bumble Bee</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

Beside it is an extinguished candle, a traditional prop in any memento mori picture; this symbol of transience and death is sufficient to link the picture to the death of van Gogh's father. In the foreground, modest yet insistent too, is a well-thumbed yellow copy of Zola's novel La joie de vivre. The metaphoric polarity implied by the juxtaposition of this book with the Bible is plain: the Bible was the father's source of authority, while the novel represented a belief that there are other things in modern life besides wisdom that has been handed down through thousands of years.\n"

An arrangement of vegetables, comprising a melon, cabbages and globe artichokes, balances them on the right-hand side. Suspended above the two groups is a ring hook, such is used for hanging game, to which five birds of differing sizes have been attached. A light source presumably located outside the painting to the left casts a strong narrow shaft of light onto the arrangement from the side. Some areas, such as the small birds skewered together on the rod at the front, remain in shadow. A softer light falls from the opposite side, a device that the painter used regularly to give body to the forms in his still-lifes.The individual motifs in the painting demonstrate a precise knowledge of the creatures depicted, which interestingly consist solely of small game. A wild duck, hanging by one leg in a dominant central position, is framed by two kingfishers, a sparrow and a blackbird, all attached to the ring. The hare lying head down on the tabletop echoes the bird's vertical lines in its outstretched body and continues them in its two front legs hanging down at the front. Two dead snipe have been placed decoratively, although in a strange position, beside the hare, while a partridge leans against a basket. A bullfinch, a goldfinch, and a variety of other finches have been skewered on a rod that projects from the table, a visual idea that is echoed by the artichokes on the other side.Adriaen van Utrecht drew inspiration in terms of both form and content from Frans Snyders, whose still-lifes with game and fowl1 contain a number of comparable motifs. But the precision in Van Utrecht's painting, his constant attention to detail, and his controlled use of colour, centring chiefly on a cool grey with shades of brown, green and violet, is stylistically much closer to Jan Fyt.\n",

      "Kalf depicted decorative objects - such as Chinese porcelain soup tureens, preciously decorated nautilus goblets and costly carpets - his paintings seem to have been dominated not so much by wealth and prosperity as by the aesthetic values and optical qualities of perception that emanated from these objects. Thus, the refraction of the light on the objects and the modification of the colours as mirrored by each of the other objects become the real subject of his art. Kalf achieved his effects by giving objects a bright luminescence, further emphasized by a dark background a method which made him a remote kinsman of the Caravaggists. His objects only exist to the extent that they can be perceived, but in order to be perceived they need light to dispel that darkness which is the original state of the world.However, unlike Caravaggio and his successors, Kalf avoided beaming any harsh shafts of light onto an object. Instead, his light is more subdued and diffuse, with a source that cannot be exactly identified (though it usually comes from above). It gives each object a minimum of brightness so that it shines faintly and transparently from within here and there, for example on the edge of a silver bowl, although there are also brightly shining spots in some places. The light dissolves, as it were, the material properties of the objects: delicately thin Chinese porcelain is perceived as fragile, brittle and transparent, penetrated softly by the light. Half-peeled oranges and lemons, with their skins spiralling down artistically, have their fruity flesh displayed in such a way that their drop-like fibres flicker golden in the light.\n",

      "This painting, painted at Beffes for General Coetlosquet, was one of the splendid collection of works which Delacroix sent to the Salon of 1827, and which included the Death of Sardanapalus as well as others from among his finest pictures. On 28 September 1827, Delacroix wrote to his friend Soulier: 'I have finished the General's animal picture, and I have dug up a rococo frame for it, which I have had regilded and which will do for it splendidly. It has already dazzled people at a gathering of amateurs, and I think it would be amusing to see it in the Salon.'Of all Delacroix's paintings, the Still-Life with Lobster reveals most clearly the impression made on the young artist by English painting. The background with its red-coated huntsmen is reminiscent of landscapes by Constable; the dead game in the foreground, and the incongruous lobster, rival the finest details in the works of Jan Fyt.Delacroix painted this picture when he returned from England; even before then, he was in close touch with English painters in Paris - Fielding and Bonington amongst others. But it was at the Salon of 1824 that he discovered the revolution which Constable had brought about in English painting, when he saw the three landscapes which the latter was exhibiting there. He hastily repainted the background of the Massacre of Scio along much the same lines; when the state bought the picture from him for 6,000 francs (a considerable sum in those days) he lost no time in spending the money on a trip to England. This opened up a new world to him: the Parthenon marbles, the Gothic style, the paintings of Lawrence and Etty, the horses (his host was the horsedealer Elmore), sailing in a yacht - a sport he was able to indulge in with an aristocratic friend of Elmore's - and the plays of Shakespeare. English painting had attracted a whole colony of French artists to London; among them EugÃ¨ne Isabey, EugÃ¨ne Lami, and Henri Monnier. Delacroix also renewed contact with Bonington, and worked in company with him. He was in London when he heard of the heroic death of Lord Byron, to whom he pays tribute in his Journal.\n",

      "De Heem painted this still-life during his first Antwerp phase. Compositionally, it is close to the ornamental still-lifes by Abraham van Beyeren of the early 1650s, who was no doubt influenced by de Heem, especially with regard to the terraced arrangement of the fruit, the mussels, the tableware and the jug. Unlike van Beijeren, however, de Heem's art scintillates with bright colours and an unsurpassable  attention to detail. Influenced by the Jesuit artist Daniel Seghers, de Heem frequently incorporated hidden religious symbolism in his paintings. In this still-life, for example, the mussel and the lobster are allusions to the resurrection, and are related to the 'Eucharistic' grapes.\n",

      "Still-life painting occasionally registers the pride that contemporaries took in global trade and colonial endeavour. Like the botanical gardens and finest collections, still-lifes gathered disparate objects from all reaches of Dutch trade, and brought them home, re-presenting them in European terms of science and collecting, without specific concern about their origin. In this painting of fine household items, Willem Kalf effortlessly combined Venetian and Dutch glassware, a recently made Chinese jar for luxury ginger, a Dutch silver dish, a Mediterranean peach, and a half-peeled lemon, the object of citrus trade and of medicinal treatises. He displayed them on an Indian floral carpet, in a dramatic spotlight that invites contemplation and admiration, for the fine wares as well as the artist's recrafting of them. Kalf's jewel technique evokes their value and unifies them in an arrangement, that, however lifelike for each individual object, is clearly pictorial.\n",

      "Just as a circle of specialists for individual genres gathered in Amsterdam around Rembrandt, the same was true in Antwerp around Rubens. Snyders frequently collaborated with him on arrangements of objects and staffage. On the other hand, Snyders also adopted Rubens' new Baroque principles into his own specialized area of still life. The result was a number of new pictorial types in this field.He initially drew upon the great kitchen interiors and pantry paintings of the Flemish Mannerists such as Aertsen or Beuckelaer. However, whereas these artists created \"epic\" arrangements of enormous breadth, Snyders sought to produce more dynamic still-lifes. He created the hunting still-life which not only features game, but also includes certain elements of the hunt itself, and in which each animal, dead or alive, still has its own tale to tell. In his portrayal of animals, he was peerless in his time. Whereas Dutch still-life presented coded \"truths\" and warned of the transience of earthly life, Snyders staged a theatrical drama portraying the riches of the world. Snyders' pantry scenes, a variation on the hunting still-life, are equally dynamic.\n",

      "Most of the earliest examples of flower paintings that arrived in Spain - especially in court circles - from the Flemish school at the beginning of the 17th century were executed by Jan Brueghel. The first Spanish painter to incorporate flower paintings into still-life scenes was Juan van der Hamen, but the artist who established them in their own right, independently of still-life scenes of foodstuffs, animals and pots and pans, was Juan de Arellano, the most influential practitioner of flower painting in the Iberian Peninsula during the central years of the century. These themes, whether depicted singly, in pairs or in series, were designed to decorate the homes of noble and wealthy families who wished to embellish their residences with decorative, pleasant and colourful paintings, as the main purpose of these pictures was ornamental. DÃ­az, who was active in the rich and noble city of Valladolid, which had been the seat of the court at the beginning of the century, must have had a clientele who commissioned paintings of this kind. Although in his main area of activity, religious painting, he was conservative and showed little evolution when it came to incorporating the novel features of the Baroque language into his style, his flower paintings reveal his knowledge of Flemish art and of the new genres in vogue during the period. The present still-life depicts a a wicker basket containing a bunch of flowers - roses, tulips, irises, hyacinths, daffodils, among others - on a table. The rich and varied colours, which stand out against a somewhat darkened neutral background, and the movement of the forms emphasise the decorative nature of the paintings.\n"

      "Many Flemish still-lifes refer in all their beauty to the transience of life but it was Franciscus Gijsbrechts who expressed this transience in the most explicit fashion. His Vanitas is conceived as a grandiose spectacle dealing with the vanity of the intellectual world (globe, books), of the 'vita voluptaria' (musical instruments, smoking implements) and, finally, of the transience of life (skull, hourglass). The moralistic meaning of these still-lifes might have lost some of its urgency as far as modern viewers are concerned, but the visual pleasure which they offer is an equally important aspect.There are similarities between Franciscus Gijsbrecht and Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, both in their choice of motif and in the range of objects portrayed. But while Cornelis Norbertus quite quickly specialised into trompe l'oeil still-lifes, Franciscus painted mostly Vanitas still-lifes.To a certain extant Franciscus painted the same accessories as Cornelis Norbertus, but typical of Franciscus are the costlier jugs and dishes, the table cloths with long fringes, the large musical instruments, draped cloths and finally the large bundles of crumpled landscape prints of drawings or unspecified papers, heavily dog-eared and overhanging the edge of a table or niche.\n",

In fact nearly all his oeuvre was dedicated to painting musical instruments, sometimes his pictures being finished by other painters who added figures (as in the case of two paintings that have recently been found in the Brera in Milan). From this specific point of view, Baschenis is one of the most fascinating and focused painters of the whole of the seventeenth century. His use of realism and light is reminiscent of Caravaggio. His canvases had an intense quality which was dominated by his exceptional technical ability (one thing that stands out is the way in which he depicted dust on the back of stringed instruments).But Baschenis' work never degenerated into a mere display of virtuoso talent. It was rather directed to convey a sense of almost severe moral purpose. Baschenis' success with still-life gave rise, especially in Bergamo itself, to a real fashion for the genre, with other painters following his example.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/16_cent/milano_lute.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Francesco da Milano: Tre fantasie for lute</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

In 1728 he was accepted as a painter of animals and fruit at the Paris Academy of Art without having to fulfil the usual requirements.The structure of this painting is simpler than in his earlier still-lifes, and Chardin has reduced the number of objects to a minimum. By singling out and thus monumentalizing the motif of the bird, Chardin gives it considerably more emphasis. According to the categories of feudal game law, the pheasant was seen as reserved for the nobility, but the hunting trophy which has been attached to the pheasant has, from a bourgeois point of view, lost its value of triumphantly demonstrating man's lordship over nature. However, the way in which the pheasant is rendered does not indicate in any way that colour is gradually becoming detached from the object. Rather, the careful, delicate application of the paint - even in the more roughened structures - heightens the element of sensitive empathy. Unlike the game still-lifes of his contemporaries - which have a smooth, cold objectiveness about them - the artist has created an atmosphere of intimacy between the viewer and the object.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/18_cent/haydn_autumn_23-26_hunt.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Joseph Haydn: The Seasons, Part 3 Autumn, aria and chorus (Hunters' chorus)</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

      "This painting is a variation on the artist's style as seen in his other works. However, the individual objects are no longer scattered across the forest ground but are grouped together in an arched niche, to form a fruit-basket motif that resembles the display of a harvest festival.The painting contains both Eucharistic symbols and an element of transience, indicated by the small number of rotten spots of the fruit, as well as the presence of a clock, and the dualism of good and evil. The two rather cute little animals, a squirrel and a goldfinch, are also in opposition to each other. The squirrel seems to be chained up, but on closer inspection we notice that it has managed to free itself. It has cracked open a walnut and is now eating its kernel. The squirrel had been regarded as a symbol of the evil since the Middle Ages. In this painting it embodies the unleashing of evil in the form of harmlessness. The bell collar around its neck also identifies it as a 'fool' and thus a sinner. The meaning of a squirrel eating walnut becomes obvious when we consider that St Augustine saw the walnut as a symbol of Christ, with the shell as the wood of the cross and the kernel as the life-giving nature of Christ.Unlike the squirrel, the goldfinch is a christological symbol, particularly with reference to the Passion. Its positive meaning can be gathered from its position in the upper portion of the painting (top=sphere of salvation). The actions of the bird are worth nothing. Chained to an arched semicircle, from which it can peck food out of a small container, it is pulling up a thimble-sized receptacle from the left-hand edge of the shelf. It is filled with water or - more likely - wine (as a Eucharistic symbol of the blood of Christ), which has been scooped out of a conical glass without stem or base.\n",

      "Jan Brueghel the Elder, the youngest son of the world-famous painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder and court painter to the Archdukes Albrecht and Isabella, truly merited his nickname of \"Velvet Brueghel\". The precision and virtuosity of his still-lifes are superbly illustrated by the present work with its striking and radiant enamel-like colours. This extremely elegant little panel, whichexists in several versions, can probably be counted as one of the jewels of 17th century painting. Against a chased silver-gilt tazza or drinking bowl leans a wreath of spring and summer flowers, made up of carnations, roses, anemones, periwinkles, turban buttercups, lilies of the valley, forget-me-nots and hawthorns, as well as tulips and African marigolds, newly introduced into the Netherlands.From his correspondence we know that Jan Brueghel worked mostly from nature and that such compositions cost him a great deal of effort, because of his concern to execute them with such precision and devotion. On the table lies a jewel box containing a gold ring, coins, a pearl necklace and two identical golden bracelets set with agates. In those days women mostly wore the same bracelets on both wrists. Alongside the box we can make out another three rings set with diamonds, and a pendant with enamel insets, precious stones and tear-shaped pearls. The golden pearl hairpin to the left of the tazza is an ornament that appears only in the Netherlands in the first half of the 17th century. In most cases this pin is placed in the hair next to the head covering. On the marriage day it changes side from left to right, or right to left, depending on the region. The presence of the hairpin and the pearl necklace, pointing to the immaculate marital morality of the wearer, suggests that the panel can perhaps be interpreted as an allegory of marriage.An innovative feature in this still-life is the use of diagonals. Not only the wreath, but also the jewels and the jewel case lie obliquely on the table, in order to produce a stronger effect of depth. Here wealth symbolises beauty. Both the flowers and the jewels stand out brightly against the neutral background. Brueghel paints with equal affection the humble white carnation and the baroque pendant next to it.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/19_cent/tchaikovsky_nutcracker_waltz.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker, ballet suite, op. 71, Waltz of the Flowers</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

      "De Heem's still-life paintings initially followed the style of the Haarlem school, but later drew closer to the more lavish Flemish style of large-scale still-lifes. Nevertheless, certain Dutch elements cannot be overlooked. In this painting, they are particularly evident at the points where a \"dialectical principle\" determines the compositional structure.A mass of fruit and flowers ranging from ripe chestnuts to blackberries, from columbine to roses, has been arranged on a stone slab. A wide variety of surfaces, each with a different effect in light, with pure or iridescent colours, is spread out before us. Yet snails are already crawling across the vine leaves, the foliage is discoloured and withering and, the ears of grain are curling, the peach has burst its skin, the citrus fruit is half peeled, the white carnation is dried and drooping over the table edge.At the very point where the image bears an iconographic message of the transience of worldly life in the form of nature's riches, we see these things in their last bloom of beauty. Just as a ruin could represent the picturesque appeal of architecture, so too can a vine leaf riddled with snails seem picturesque in the full and final flowering of its beauty.\n",

He made a number of still-lifes of flowers, but he owes his reputation to his many still-lifes of fish. He depicted with great skill the moist waxiness of fish and oysters.He seems to have arrived fairly quickly at a well-laid-out scheme to which he adhered for the rest of his life. He has a striking diagonal asymmetric composition, with motifs overlapping one another and arranged over several planes, with a generally sober tonality, even tending to monochrome. In the use of some motifs he seems to have been influenced by Frans Snyders.\n",

This bring the still-life close to contemporary tonal landscape. There is another aspect (apart from the attempts to reduce the colours to a common denominator) and that is the curiously indeterminate space. The objects are put on a table, but the table is placed against a plain background which is strangely transparent with dull light. The still-life almost seems to float, like the mirage of trees on the still, reflective water in the river landscapes of Salomon van Ruysdael. Since the back-edge of the table is obscured from view, making a measurement of space is almost impossible.An occasional symbol may be slipped in the still-life.

This type of composition seems to have originated in Rome during the early 1620s and is seen in works attributed to Tomasso Salini and Agostino Verrocchi. However, van der Hamen's use of this scheme differs from that of the Roman painters, who liked to scatter a profusion of  inanimate objects over the surface. Van der Hamen drastically reduces the number of elements and arranges the remainder into exquisitely balanced, asymmetrical compositions, strongly lit in the Spanish manner. This allows him to concentrate on the rendering of each individual object and thus to enhance the sensation of corporeality and texture.\n"

      "Baschenis, an artist from Bergamo, was a highly specialized painter who worked almost exclusively on the portrayal of stringed instruments. The nearby town of Cremona, a famous centre of violin and lute making, provided him with his models. However, unlike the Netherlandish artists, who often used musical instruments as symbols of hearing, while the transience of the notes recalled the transience of life, Baschenis does not paint scenes of allegorical or moral significance. His emphasis lies on the aesthetic and decorative aspects, as reflected in his singular attention to painterly and ornamental detail in portraying these instruments.A theorbo, a tenor lute and a descant lute, as well as a violin with bow can be seen together with a writing box, a quill and a book of music set on a table against which a cello is leaning. A mysterious life develops between these objects. The mild sheen on the surface of the woods and the changing hues on the body of the lute create a visual autonomy that almost makes us forget the actual purpose of these instruments. Their curves present unusual viewpoints as though by chance. These musical objects are an almost tangible feast of tranquillity for the eyes.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 14 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/18_cent/handel_theorbo.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>George Frideric Handel: Concerto for harp, lute and theorbo in B flat major</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

His youthful pictures of flowers, fruit, and shells are in the manner of Balthasar van der Ast, and he also painted simple, restrained still-lifes which show his mastery of the chiaroscuro and the subtle tonal treatment of Claesz and Heda.This painting was painted and signed together with Nicolaes van Veerendael. Both painters worked in Utrecht and were specialized to flower still-life.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/schubert/schubert_d431_blumen.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n"

These two paintings are most unusual still-lifes and, at the same time, figure pieces.In this painting the woman is a cast of the upper section of the Venus Medici, a full-length sculpture of a nude. It was at the Villa Medici in Rome until 1677 when it was transferred to the Uffizi in Florence. It is a copy after a Greek original dating from the late classical era.

      "A \"tiny banquet\" or \"small breakfast\" is best seen as the sober counterpart to the ostentatious Dutch 17th century still-lifes. The number of objects portrayed is limited, the colour palette muted: black, white, grey and brown in every shade define the atmosphere. Connoisseurs frequently deprecate Maerten Boelema de Stomme's often slightly out-of balance and over-busy compositions, with objects piled one on top of another. However, this painting is repeatedly cited as a time when Boelema de Stomme equals his teacher Heda.A round, voluminous object in the form of a bearded man's crock placed in a diagonal beam of light is chosen to form the centre of a composition which seeks to perform a dangerous balancing act, its excess weight having to be neutralised over the rest of the painting. A second eye-catching item, a precious nautilus beaker, is placed on the one visible corner of the table, reflecting the white of the table cloth and standing out starkly against the dark, neutral background of the upper right-hand corner. The oval and circular shapes of the plates with simple foodstuffs echo and inter-link the shapes of the main objects. A fluted glass, flanked to the right by a step glass, provide the top of a triangle in the composition. The salt cellar and an overturned berkemeier wineglass fill the lower left corner of the tableau.A second connecting line runs between three objects: a knife with a blocked handle, to the left on a plate, refers to its dark black knife-case, the down-hanging top of which counterbalances the upward movement of the fluted glass. Only an opened walnut and hazelnut, close to the pealed lemon, suggest that the laid table has already been touched. The nuts strewn between the other objects produce a concentration of smaller ovals that attract the viewer's eyes as to the centre of a whirlpool: the nuts themselves, the opening of the crock, its cover, the surface of the cut-open fruit, the wire foot and the thorn knobs on the wineglass, the ball-feet of the salt cellar.The artist sparingly distributes a few yellow colour accents over the picture surface in the lemons and the bread roll. A blue-green touch is visible solely in the mother-of pearl sheen of the nautilus shell cup: the rarer something is, the greater its value. \n",

In still-lifes he could explore ways of establishing visual harmony and three-dimensionality more thoroughly.In the latter half of the 1890s CÃ©zanne increasingly did more opulent, spatially more dynamic, indeed baroque compositions. These pictures are far removed from the straight representation of a laid table. No one would pile crockery, fruit, a brocade drape and a crumpled tablecloth on a chest in this way.

The foreshortening of the flowers is adequately handled, but in terms of skill falls short of the best flower painters of the time, who made a virtue of presenting a wide variety of blooms from different angles.The painting offers the viewer the refreshing sight of flowers and water, and appeals to the senses not only through the imaginary scent of the flowers, but also through the delightful sound of falling water.\n"

He knew the habits of these creatures very well and is known to have bred snakes, lizards and insects himself.

On the ledge there are two  small clay pipes. The inscription on the sheet of music under the glass reads: 'That which exists out of measure perishes in evil immeasurably'. To the initiated, the implication is clear. Overindulgence in drinking or smoking tobacco (an intoxicant recently introduced from the New World) should be curbed. Hence the horse's bridle, and the water flagon and wine jug that flank the roemer, for if wine is diluted with water its intoxicating effect is tempered.\n"

Most people would rather study a picture of an exquisitely laid table than one of a mess of fish. But van Beyeren's celebrations of the abundance of the sea are as remarkable as his festive dinner tables. In them he sometimes includes a glimpse of a beach in the background. The fish and crustacea he painted always look wet - they appear to have been just taken from the water - and the mother-of pearl greys of his creatures of the sea, their browns, silvers, and white are as delicate and finely felt as the colour accords in his more showy pieces.\n",

In Holland, such collaborations were less frequent, although it did occur. In Dutch still-life the joining forces of Pieter Claesz. and his fellow-townsman in Haarlem, Roelof Koets  is an example that stands out.The two painters were friends, living in Haarlem. They testified several times together as witnesses in lawsuits. They produced ten collaborative paintings, dating between 1644 and 1653. In these paintings Koets's hand can easily be distinguished: his sidelong lighting is more dramatic and more playful than that of Pieter Claesz., his foliage comes out stronger against a darker background, his oblong grapes are build up out of thin transparent layers.\n"

In this composition the roses, carnations, thistles, peonies, the green leaves and stems tumble out of the glass vase in a haphazard fashion. This arrangement gives the subject volume and creates a natural setting. Van Aelst has silhouetted the objects against a dark background. The flowers, glass vase, velvet and the marble are bathed in a sharp light from the left which accentuates the textures and colours of these lustrous items.<!-- <TABLE ALIGN=LEFT CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=320 BGCOLOR=\"#99CCCC\"><TR VALIGN=MIDDLE><TD><img src=\"/support/gif/listen.gif\" BORDER=0 VALIGN=MIDDLE>Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):<BR><A HREF=\"#\" onClick=\"w=window.open ('/music1/19_cent/tchaikovsky_nutcracker_waltz.html', 'newWin', 'scrollbars=yes,status=no,dependent=yes,screenX=0,screenY=0,width=350,height=350');w.opener=this;w.focus();return true\"><B>Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker, ballet suite, op. 71, Waltz of the Flowers</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE> -->\n",

      "It can hardly be a coincidence that armour and weapons often occur in still-lifes painted during the Thirty Years' War. This war, which caused unimaginable suffering, was originally started by the Spanish-Austrian House of Habsburg together with the League of the Roman Catholic Estates of the Empire. They were committed to the Counter-Reformation and wanted to re-catholicize the rebellious Republic of the United Netherlands after it had become independent in 1609, and in particular to conquer the economic resources of this wealthy country. Subsequently, however, the war spread more an more widely, with the involvement of an increasing number of countries. Dragging on interminably, the final phase was marked by soldiers pillaging, looting and brutally exploiting the civilian population.This is the background of paintings like Poorter's still-life. Painted in 1636, it provides an emblematic, impressionist commentary on the war. In 1634 the Imperial troops had gained a victory at NÃ¶rdlingen, so that the situation changed in favour of the League. This may well explain the \"vanitas\" character of the painting, expressed in the skull and the sarcophagus behind the banner which divides the picture diagonally into two parts. Thus, the victories of the other side are made to seem bearable, as they are mere vanity in the face of eternity. The crown and sceptre on the sarcophagus are a clear reference to the Emperor's power.\n",

Most of the fruit are in overly ripe state. The over ripeness of the fruit, their blemishes and signs of decay are indicators that Roepel's still life is not simply a celebration of nature's abundance but a reminder of the transience of life. \n",

      "This still-life from the collection of Margrave Hermann von Baden-Baden, which has - probably correctly - been ascribed to Frans Snyders, may have belonged to Rubens at one time. It is one of the few examples of early 17th-century Flemish paintings which do not show market or kitchen scenes but the agricultural sphere of the production itself. However, it is worth noting that the farmer's labour, as a source of the new wealth, has been completely delegated to the background (small section in the top right corner).\n",

      "Although Van Aelst is most admired for elegant still-lifes with fine glassware, silver vessels, fruit and flowers, this representation of humbler motifs must be considered one of his finest early work. The subject here is a 'vanitas', with a recently extinguished candle set in a holder on a stone ledge, and a mouse nibbling at walnut crumbs.Although mice occur in 17th-century still-lifes (e.g. in paintings by Abraham van Beyeren, Georg Flegel, Jacob Vosmaer), the specific combination of a mouse and an expired candle is unique.\n",

The message of their pictures of skulls, timepieces, and just extinguished but still smoking candles is quite clear. All the evidence suggests that these artists made very few drawings. No works on paper by Harmen have come to light, and by Pieter there are only a very few. These include genre pieces and the Vanitas Still-Life with Gorget and Cuirass. This drawn still-life is distinguished from the artist's paintings by its vertical format and its subject matter.\n",

      "https://www.wga.hu/art/z/zurbarax/stillife.jpg\n",
      "The authorship of this still-life painting remains uncertain. It has been considered a work by Francisco de ZurbarÃ¡n. The almost geometrical roundness and sharply delineated contours of the apples are reminiscent of ZurbarÃ¡n's treatment of the fruit in some of his still-lifes while the motif of fruit on a reflective silver or pewter plate appears in the paintings of both ZurbarÃ¡n and his son Juan. The painting is also close in sensibility to the still lifes of Pedro de CamprobÃ­n. The elegant motif of the tall glass containing a single sprig of orange blossom is reminiscent of the small glass vessels with flowers that appear in the works of CamprobÃ­n. However, a number of stylistic features of the painting suggest that Juan de ZurbarÃ¡n may be its author and it perhaps dates the from the early years of his short career, when an admiration for the style of his father prevailed.The appeal of the painting lies in the exquisite simplicity of the artist's presentation of the modest subject matter, a plate of red and gold apples on a silver plate and a single flower in a glass. This is, however, an enhanced vision of the beauty of the natural motifs.\n"

The series of drawings served Van der Ast as a source of motifs for a number of his paintings. The British Museum's still-life was obviously not meant as a study but as a finished product.

      "The work of the Dutch still-life painters who appear around 1620 corresponds to the tonal trend of the landscapists of van Goyen's generation. Pieter Claesz and Willem Claesz. Heda, popularizers of the breakfast piece, are the principal representatives of this phase. Claesz, the father of the landscapist Nicolaes Berchem, was born at Berchem (probably the village near Antwerp). Heda's origins are obscure. Both were primarily active at Haarlem and underwent similar stylistic developments.Their early works show the influence of the older still-life painters, but they soon limited themselves to the description of a simple meal set near the corner of a table - some bread and cheese, a herring on a pewter dish, a glass of beer or wine, perhaps a silvery pewter vessel, and a white crumpled tablecloth - just enough to suggest a light breakfast or snack. These objects, which always look as if they had been touched by someone who is still close by, are no longer treated as isolated entities: they are grouped together, forming masses along a single diagonal axis. But more important, Pieter Claesz and Heda reacted to the comprehensive forces of light and atmosphere which envelop us and the things with which we live, and they found means to express their reactions to these forces as accurately, immediately, and intensely as possible. As a result, they seem to animate their simple subjects. With a new pictorial mode, they achieve a more dynamic spatial and compositional treatment.The foreground of their unpretentious arrangements becomes spacious, and there is clear recession. Instead of vivid local colours, monochromatic harmonies with sensitive contrasts of valeurs of low intensity are favoured, without, however, a loss of the earlier regard for textural differentiation. From the point of view of composition and of colouristic, tonal, and spatial treatment the perfectly balanced still-lifes by Claesz and Heda are among the most satisfying Dutch paintings made during the century.Claesz has a more vigorous touch than Heda. He was also a man of simpler tastes. Heda depicts oysters more frequently than herrings, and after 1640 his compositions became larger, richer, and more decorative. To obtain a more monumental effect, during his maturity Heda often abandons the traditional horizontal format for a vertical one. Ornate silver vessels and costly 'faÃ§on de Venise' glasses, at the time blown in the Netherlands as well as Venice, intensify the contrasts of valeurs, and touches of colour provided by the pink of sliced hams and ripe fruit are combined with an increased chiaroscuro.\n",

      "Sanchez Cotan studied in Toledo and here he established the prototype of the Spanish still-life composed mainly from vegetables.Everyday objects: a melon, cut open to reveal its pale pink flesh, a knobby cucumber, a yellow quince that is past its best, a cabbage with thick leaves. Parallel to the picture plane, a smooth frame delineates the opening for a window. From the direction of the spectator, light falls upon the parapet, on which the slice of melon and the cucumber are placed so that they jut over slightly and thereby they seem to be almost within reach - a trompe l'oeil effect that was particularly popular in Netherlandish painting in the 17th century. The head of cabbage and the quince, suspended on threads that presumably have been attached to the upper frame, are dangling over the gaping darkness.Even if the objects are arranged so that they seem close enough to touch, they are nevertheless distanced. For all the naturalism with which they are depicted, the isolation of each object, heightened further by the black background, makes each of them seem extremely artificial and lends them a monumental, almost sculptural gravity. The centre of the picture is empty and the arrangement seems coincidental; the dimension of the painted picture is denied. The disturbing evocation of the painted picture is the main theme.\n",

The Wan-Li vase is an allusion to flourishing trade with the East and the rare flowers of the wealth and prosperity it had brought. The outer petals of the red and yellow tulip are just beginning to curl back and those of the rose are very slightly browning at their edges. The very beginning of their decay reminds the viewer of the fragility of life, serving as a subtle memento mori, while the caterpillar in turn signifies renewal and rebirth.\n",

      "https://www.wga.hu/art/f/flegel/breadcon.jpg\n",
      "In the culinary culture of the aristocracy and the patrician middle classes, banquets consisted of six to eight - sometimes even nine - courses and were always concluded by a dessert. Interest in desserts came to a climax at a time when numerous delicacies had been introduced as new luxuries. This was especially true for sugar confectionary, which appeared in still-lifes around 1600 for the first time. The introduction of sugar marked a radical revolution of taste. Initially it was only used for pharmaceutical purposes, but it soon replaced honey as a sweetener and a food.The crystalline structure of the candied sugar was rendered especially accurately by Georg Flegel in his confectionary still-life. His painting shows candied fruit on a table in the foreground, including two figs on the right, encrusted with large sugar crystals. Some of the fruits have been cut up in the shape of letters, for example a large 'O' can be made out as well as a crumbled 'A' beside the loaf of bread. A straight piece of sugar is lying across the loaf like a cross-beam and is being approached by a disproportionately large bee. The earthenware bowl with the blue pattern contains candied fruit dusted with icing sugar, and a brimstone butterfly, whose wings also show traces of sugar, has alighted on it.Flegel added a religious dimension, because the seemingly innocuous arrangement is full of Christian allusions. For example, the letters 'A' and 'O' (Alpha and Omega) as the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet are a reference to Apocalypse 1:8 and 21:6, where Christ is referred to as the beginning and the end. The cross formed by the loaf and the piece of sugar emphasizes this aspect even further. Finally, as a reminder of the Eucharist, there is the bread and wine in the dainty glass, with decorations resembling amphora handles which drop down in the form of grape-like clusters at the bottom. The redemptive work of Christ is called to mind by the butterfly, an ancient symbol of the human soul as well of the resurrection, as new life comes forth from a seemingly dead chrysalis. The heart on the right is a specially shaped piece of bread, made from communion wafer dough, and is apparently meant to remind the viewer of the heart of Christ.In Flegel's art, sugar has entirely taken over the religious connotations of honey, which was understood as a symbol of 'spiritual sweetness' during the Middle ages.\n"

The light is also refracted by the transparent glass and the wine itself. On the marble table there are three bergamot or Seville oranges and a lemon. Jutting out over the table's edge, a knife with a polished agate handle protrudes through the bright yellow lemon peel, and the porous strip of skin, peeled off in one piece, curls around like a festoon, forming a decorative counterpart to the narrow pointed orange leaves. Showing sweet and sour citrus fruits together in this way, the artist symbolically admonishes the viewer to be temperate and to add lemon and orange juice to wine, as they were considered to have medicinal, humoral and pathological properties.\n",

      "This Flemish artist's teacher and uncle was Jan Brueghel the Younger, and therefore he was a direct descendant on his mother's side from Pieter the Elder and Jan the Elder. He painted chiefly still-lifes, frequently representing food laid out sumptuously on light-coloured tables and depicted with the delicacy of a miniaturist, using lively colours of a predominately red tint laid on with the tip of the brush.The documentary, informative, educational, and communicative function of these richly laid tables, in which the individual objects are simply added on and depicted from a slightly raised viewpoint, is combined with the evident intention of demonstrating the affluence of the wealthy patrons of these works. It is also possible to discern allegorical intentions alluding to the five senses or the four elements, but while such an interpretation is quite plausible, the principal aim is a purely aesthetic one, offering this profusion of beautiful objects, rendered with exquisite skill, as a simple feast for the eyes.There is a companion piece to this painting, a variation on the same theme, also on show in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.\n",

      "Salomon van Ruysdael, who was a few years younger than van Goyen, shares with him the fame of tonal landscape in Holland, though he moved more slowly and differed considerable from van Goyen's vivacious temperament. In his landscape production he is less versatile and more uniform than van Goyen, although for a while, and rather late in his career, (from about 1659 to 1662) he tried his hand at a different subject matter, painting some still-lifes and hunting trophies.In his still-lifes Ruysdael always represented objects set on a marble tabletop. Probably he painted the artificial marble he had invented, which, according to Houbraken could not be distinguished from the real thing.\n",

      "One of the most characteristic types of painting in Holland in the seventeenth century was still-life which was brought to a higher level of refinement there than anywhere else in Europe. Some still-lifes have symbolic meanings - the vanity of earthly wealth - but others, including those of the greatest practitioner of this genre, Willem Kalf, seem to be simply pronkstilleven, lavish displays of ceramics, glassware, gold and silver vessels as well as exotic food. They reflect a new willingness of rich Dutchmen to parade their possessions, an attitude which would have been frowned upon by an earlier, more puritanical generation.Kalf was born in Rotterdam and probably trained in the studio of FranÃ§ois Ryckhals in Middelburg, a town with a long established tradition of still-life painting. Subsequently he lived for some years in Paris where he met Flemish still-life artists, whose painterly style softened the linearity of Kalf's earliest manner. Kalf returned to Rotterdam but settled in Amsterdam in 1653 with his wife Cornelia Pluvier, a distinguished glassengraver, poetess and musician. In the following year Kalf was praised by the poet Jan Vos as one of the city's leading painters: he was much sought after by prosperous citizens anxious to record their treasures. This particular painting includes a richly decorated nautilus cup and a Wan-Li bowl, which were no doubt prized possessions of the unknown Amsterdammer who commissioned the still-life.\n",

      "https://www.wga.hu/art/a/ast/apple.jpg\n",
      "Still-life paintings were popular in Dutch art and began to emerge as a genre in their own right during the 16th century. Despite their popularity with the general public, art academies of the period did not regard them as highly as landscape or religious paintings.\n"
